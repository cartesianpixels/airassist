The ATO develops, implements, and maintains processes, tools, and guiding principles within the framework of a Safety Management System (SMS) to ensure that performance‐based NAS safety goals are achieved. The ATO SMS gives the responsibility for owning and executing the SMS to all employees at all levels of the ATO. All ATO employees must strive not only to maintain safety in the NAS for those services they provide but also to continuously improve the ATO SMS. Direction regarding the ATO SMS and its application is found in FAA Order JO 1000.37, Air Traffic Organization Safety Management System. Additional information pertaining to ATO SMS requirements and processes can be obtained by visiting the SMS Toolbox, emailing the Office of Safety and Technical Training (AJI) at 9‐AJI‐SMS@faa.gov, or contacting the service center Quality Control Group. SMS training is available for all employees via eLMS.  Additional courses along with Technical Training for SMS Practitioners and SMS Facilitators are available from AJI.\nREFERENCES TO FAA NON‐AIR TRAFFIC ORGANIZATIONS\nWhen references are made to regional office organizations that are not part of the Air Traffic Organization (Communications Center, Flight Standards, Airport offices, etc.), the facility should contact the FAA region where the facility is physically located—not the region where the facility's service area office is located.\nDISTRIBUTION\nThis order is distributed to selected offices in Washington headquarters, regional offices, service area offices, the William J. Hughes Technical Center, the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, and to all air traffic field facilities and international aviation field offices.\nThis order is distributed electronically to all who subscribe to receive email notifications through the FAA's website. All organizations are responsible for viewing, downloading, and subscribing to receive email notifications when changes occur to this order. Subscriptions to air traffic directives can be made through the Air Traffic Plans and Publications website at https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ or directly via the following link: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USAFAA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USAFAA_39.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Terms of ReferenceWORD MEANINGS\nAs used in this order:\n“Must” means a procedure is mandatory.\n“Must not” means a procedure is prohibited.\n“Should” means a procedure is recommended.\n“May” or “need not” means a procedure is optional.\n“Will” means futurity, not a requirement for the application of a procedure.\nSingular words include the plural.\nPlural words include the singular.\n“Aircraft” means the airframe, crew members, or both.\n“Approved separation” means separation in accordance with the applicable minima in this order.\n“Altitude” means indicated altitude mean sea level (MSL), flight level (FL), or both.\n“Miles” means nautical miles unless otherwise specified, and means statute miles in conjunction with visibility.\n“Course,” “bearing,” “azimuth,” “heading,” and “wind direction” information must always be magnetic unless specifically stated otherwise.\n“Time” when used for ATC operational activities, is the hour and the minute in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Change to the next minute is made at the minute plus 30 seconds, except time checks are given to the nearest quarter minute.\n“Runway” means the runway used by aircraft and, unless otherwise specified, does not include helipads and/or their accompanying takeoff/landing courses. (See Pilot/Controller Glossary terms - Runway and Helipad.)\nFlight operations in accordance with the options of “due regard” or “operational” have the following requirements:\nObligates the authorized state aircraft commander to:\nSeparate his/her aircraft from all other air traffic; and\nAssure that an appropriate monitoring agency assumes responsibility for search and rescue actions; and\nOperate under at least one of the following conditions:\nIn visual meteorological conditions (VMC); or\nWithin an area that is covered by an ATC surveillance source and in communications with ATC, or within surveillance source service volume and radio communications range of a facility, Department of Homeland Security or DoD unit capable of providing the pilot assistance to operate with due regard to other aircraft; or\nBe equipped with airborne radar that is sufficient to provide separation between his/her aircraft and any other aircraft he/she may be controlling and other aircraft; or\nOperate within Class G airspace.\nAn understanding between the pilot and controller regarding the intent of the pilot and the status of the flight should be reached before the aircraft leaves ATC frequency.\nNOTE-\nA pilot's use of the phrase “Going Tactical” does not indicate “Due Regard.”\nThe above conditions provide for a level of safety equivalent to that normally given by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ATC agencies and fulfills U.S. Government obligations under Article 3, paragraph d, of the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates there must be “due regard for the safety of navigation of civil aircraft” when flight is not being conducted under ICAO flight procedures.\nREFERENCE-\nDoD Instruction (DoDI) 4540.1, Enclosure 3, Para 3c(1)(c).\nDoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP), Section 8-6c(1).\n“CFR” means Code of Federal Regulations.\nFIG 1-2-1Divergence\nCOURSE DEFINITIONS\nThe following definitions must be used in the application of the separation criteria in this order.\nNOTE-\nThe term “protected airspace,” as used in this paragraph, is the airspace equal to one half the required applicable lateral separation on either side of an aircraft along its projected flight path. If the protected airspace of two aircraft does not overlap, applicable lateral separation is ensured.\nSAME COURSES are courses whose protected airspaces are coincident, overlap, or intersect and whose angular difference is less than 45 degrees. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\nCROSSING COURSES are intersecting courses whose angular difference is 45 through 135 degrees inclusive. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\nOPPOSITE/RECIPROCAL COURSES are courses whose protected airspaces are coincident, overlap, or intersect and whose angular difference is greater than 135 degrees through 180 degrees inclusive. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\nNOTES\nStatements of fact, or of a prefatory or explanatory nature relating to directive material, are set forth as notes.\nREFERENCES\nAs used in this order, references direct attention to an additional or supporting source of information such as FAA, NWS, and other agencies' orders, directives, notices, CFRs, and Advisory Circulars (ACs).\nANNOTATIONS\nRevised, reprinted, or new pages are marked as follows:\nThe change number and the effective date are printed on each revised or additional page.\nA page that does not require a change is reprinted in its original form.\nBold vertical lines in the margin of changed pages indicate the location of substantive revisions to the order. Bold vertical lines adjacent to the title of a chapter, section, or paragraph means that extensive changes have been made to that chapter, section, or paragraph.\nParagraphs/sections annotated with EN ROUTE, OCEANIC, or TERMINAL are only to be applied by the designated type facility. When they are not so designated, the paragraphs/sections apply to all types of facilities (en route, oceanic, and terminal).\nThe annotation, USAF for the U.S. Air Force, USN for the U.S. Navy, and USA for the U.S. Army denotes that the procedure immediately following the annotation applies only to the designated service.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-12, Military Procedures.\nWAKE TURBULENCE APPLICATION inserted within a paragraph means that the remaining information in the paragraph requires the application of wake turbulence procedures.\nThe annotation PHRASEOLOGY denotes the prescribed words and/or phrases to be used in communications.\nNOTE-\nControllers may, after first using the prescribed phraseology for a specific procedure, rephrase the message to ensure the content is understood. Good judgment must be exercised when using nonstandard phraseology.\nThe annotation EXAMPLE provides a sample of the way the prescribed phraseology associated with the preceding paragraph(s) will be used. If the preceding paragraph(s) does (do) not include specific prescribed phraseology, the EXAMPLE merely denotes suggested words and/or phrases that may be used in communications.\nNOTE-\nThe use of the exact text contained in an example not preceded with specific prescribed phraseology is not mandatory. However, the words and/or phrases are expected, to the extent practical, to approximate those used in the example.\nABBREVIATIONS\nAs used in this order, the abbreviations listed below have the following meanings indicated.

GeneralATC SERVICE\nThe primary purpose of the ATC system is to prevent a collision involving aircraft operating in the system.\nIn addition to its primary purpose, the ATC system also:\nProvides a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic.\nSupports National Security and Homeland Defense missions.\nThe ATC system must provide certain additional services to the extent permitted. The provision of additional services is not optional on the part of the controller, but rather required when the work situation permits. It is recognized that the provision of these services may be precluded by various factors, including, but not limited to:\nVolume of traffic.\nFrequency congestion.\nQuality of surveillance.\nController workload.\nHigher priority duties.\nThe physical inability to scan and detect situations falling in this category.\nControllers must provide air traffic control service in accordance with the procedures and minima in this order, except when one or more of the following conditions exists:\nA deviation is necessary to conform with ICAO Documents, National Rules of the Air, or special agreements where the U.S. provides air traffic control service in airspace outside the U.S. and its possessions or:\nNOTE-\nPilots are required to abide by CFRs or other applicable regulations regardless of the application of any procedure or minima in this order.\nOther procedures/minima are prescribed in a letter of agreement, FAA directive, or a military document, or:\nNOTE-\nThese procedures may include altitude reservations, air refueling, fighter interceptor operations, law enforcement, etc.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-1-10, Procedural Letters of Agreement (LOAs).\nA deviation is necessary to assist an aircraft when an emergency has been declared.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 10, Emergencies.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-1-4, Merging Target Procedures.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 2-1-1 c, ATC Service; Emergencies and 10-1-1 d, Emergency Determinations (6-11-2015)\nAir Traffic Control services are not provided for model aircraft operating in the NAS or to any UAS operating in the NAS at or below 400ft AGL.\nNOTE-\nThis does not prohibit ATC from providing services to civil and public UAS.\nThe provisions of this paragraph apply to model aircraft operating at any altitude. For all other UAS, this paragraph applies only to those UAS operating entirely at or below 400ft AGL.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - MODEL AIRCRAFT.\nDUTY PRIORITY\nGive first priority to separating aircraft and issuing safety alerts as required in this order. Good judgment must be used in prioritizing all other provisions of this order based on the requirements of the situation at hand.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nNOTE-\nBecause there are many variables involved, it is virtually impossible to develop a standard list of duty priorities that would apply uniformly to every conceivable situation. Each set of circumstances must be evaluated on its own merit, and when more than one action is required, controllers must exercise their best judgment based on the facts and circumstances known to them. That action which is most critical from a safety standpoint is performed first.\nProvide support to national security and homeland defense activities to include, but not be limited to, reporting of suspicious and/or unusual aircraft/pilot activities.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations.\nProvide and/or solicit weather information in accordance with procedures and requirements outlined in this order.\nNOTE-\nControllers are responsible to become familiar with and stay aware of current weather information needed to perform ATC duties.\nProvide additional services to the extent possible, contingent only upon higher priority duties and other factors including limitations of radar, volume of traffic, frequency congestion, and workload.\nPROCEDURAL PREFERENCE\nUse automation procedures in preference to nonautomation procedures when workload, communications, and equipment capabilities permit.\nUse automation procedures that provide closed loop clearances in preference to open loop clearances to promote operational advantage for time-based management (TBM) when workload permits. (e.g., a QU route pick that anticipates length of vector and includes the next fix that ties into the route of flight.)\nUse radar separation in preference to nonradar separation when it will be to an operational advantage and workload, communications, and equipment permit.\nUse nonradar separation in preference to radar separation when the situation dictates that an operational advantage will be gained.\nNOTE-\nOne situation may be where vertical separation would preclude excessive vectoring.\nOPERATIONAL PRIORITY\nIt is recognized that traffic flow may affect the controller's ability to provide priority handling. However, without compromising safety, good judgment must be used in each situation to facilitate the most expeditious movement of priority aircraft. Provide air traffic control service to aircraft on a “first come, first served” basis as circumstances permit, except the following:\nNOTE-\nIt is solely the pilot's prerogative to cancel an IFR flight plan. However, a pilot's retention of an IFR flight plan does not afford priority over VFR aircraft. For example, this does not preclude the requirement for the pilot of an arriving IFR aircraft to adjust his/her flight path, as necessary, to enter a traffic pattern in sequence with arriving VFR aircraft.\nAn aircraft in distress has the right of way over all other air traffic.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR Section 91.113(c).\nTreat air ambulance flights as follows:\nProvide priority handling to civil air ambulance flights when the pilot, in radio transmissions, verbally identifies the flight by stating “MEDEVAC” followed by the FAA authorized call sign or the full civil registration letters/numbers. Good judgment must be used in each situation to facilitate the most expeditious movement of a MEDEVAC aircraft.\nNOTE-\nIf a flight plan includes the letter “L” for “MEDEVAC” and/or includes “MEDEVAC” in Item 11 (Remarks) of the flight plan or Item 18 (Other Information) of an international flight plan, the entries are considered informational in nature only and not an identification for operational priority.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nProvide priority handling to AIR EVAC and HOSP flights when verbally requested by the pilot.\nNOTE-\nIf a flight plan includes “HOSP” or “AIR EVAC” in either Item 11 (Remarks) or Item 18 (Other Information) of an international flight plan, the entries are considered informational in nature only and not an identification for operational priority. For aircraft identification in radio transmissions, civilian pilots will use normal call signs when filing “HOSP” and military pilots will use the “EVAC” call sign.\nAssist the pilots of MEDEVAC, AIR EVAC, and HOSP aircraft to avoid areas of significant weather and adverse conditions.\nIf requested by a pilot, provide additional assistance (i.e., landline notifications) to expedite ground handling of patients, vital organs, or urgently needed medical materials.\nProvide priority handling and expedite the movement of presidential aircraft and entourage and any rescue support aircraft as well as related control messages when traffic conditions and communications facilities permit.\nNOTE-\nAs used herein the terms presidential aircraft and entourage include aircraft and entourage of the President, Vice President, or other public figures when designated by the White House.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-2, Departure Clearances.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-1-1, Advance Coordination.\nProvide priority handling and maximum assistance to SAR aircraft performing a SAR mission.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-3, Providing Assistance.\nProvide priority handling and maximum assistance to expedite the movement of interceptor aircraft on active air defense missions until the unknown aircraft is identified.\nProvide priority handling to NIGHT WATCH “NAOC” (pronounced NAY-OCK) aircraft when notified via landline or when “NAOC” is used in air/ground communications. When the term “NAOC” is used, approve any request(s) as soon as practicable.\nNOTE-\nThe term “NAOC” will not be a part of the Flight ID in the flight plan or used in conjunction with the call sign but may otherwise be used when the aircraft is airborne.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 9-1-1, Applications.\nProvide priority handling to any civil or military aircraft using the code name “FLYNET.\"\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-5, FLYNET.\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 9-4-1, “FLYNET” Flights, Nuclear Emergency Teams.\nProvide priority handling to aircraft using the code name “Garden Plot” only when CARF notifies you that such priority is authorized. Refer any questions regarding flight procedures to CARF for resolution.\nNOTE-\nGarden Plot flights require priority movement and are coordinated by the military with CARF. State authority will contact the Regional Administrator to arrange for priority of National Guard troop movements within a particular state.\nProvide priority handling to USAF or other government aircraft engaged in aerial sampling/surveying missions using the call sign “SAMP.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-17, SAMP Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-3-2, Aerial Sampling/Surveying For Airborne Contamination.\nProvide priority handling to Special Air Mission “SCOOT” aircraft when notified via landline or when “SCOOT” is used in air/ground communications. When the term “SCOOT” is used, approve any request(s) as soon as practicable.\nNOTE-\nThe term “SCOOT” will not be a part of the Flight ID in the flight plan but may be used during radio communications in conjunction with the call sign.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 9-6-1, Applications.\nWhen requested, provide priority handling to TEAL and NOAA mission aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-19, Weather Reconnaissance Flights.\nProvide priority handling, as required to expedite Flight Check aircraft.\nNOTE-\nIt is recognized that unexpected wind conditions, weather, or heavy traffic flows may affect controller's ability to provide priority or special handling at the specific time requested.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-1-3, Flight Check Aircraft.\nIFR aircraft must have priority over SVFR aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 7, Section 5, Special VFR (SVFR).\nAircraft operating under the North American Route Program (NRP) are not subject to route limiting restrictions (e.g., published preferred IFR routes, letter of agreement requirements, standard operating procedures).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-15, North American Route Program (NRP) Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 18, Section 17, North American Route Program.\nIf able, provide priority handling to diverted flights. Priority handling may be requested via use of “DVRSN\" in the remarks section of the flight plan or by the flight being placed on the Diversion Recovery Tool (DRT).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 18-4-5, Diversion Recovery.\nIf able, provide priority handling to FALLEN HERO flights when “FALLEN HERO\" is indicated in the remarks section of the flight plan or requested in air/ground communications.\nEXPEDITIOUS COMPLIANCE\nUse the word “immediately” only when expeditious compliance is required to avoid an imminent situation.\nUse the word “expedite” only when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an imminent situation. If an “expedite\" climb or descent clearance is issued by ATC, and subsequently the altitude to maintain is changed or restated without an expedite instruction, the expedite instruction is canceled.\nIn either case, if time permits, include the reason for this action.\nSAFETY ALERT\nIssue a safety alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is in a position/altitude that, in your judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft. Once the pilot informs you action is being taken to resolve the situation, you may discontinue the issuance of further alerts. Do not assume that because someone else has responsibility for the aircraft that the unsafe situation has been observed and the safety alert issued; inform the appropriate controller.\nNOTE-\nThe issuance of a safety alert is a first priority (see paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority) once the controller observes and recognizes a situation of unsafe aircraft proximity to terrain, obstacles, or other aircraft. Conditions, such as workload, traffic volume, the quality/limitations of the radar system, and the available lead time to react are factors in determining whether it is reasonable for the controller to observe and recognize such situations. While a controller cannot see immediately the development of every situation where a safety alert must be issued, the controller must remain vigilant for such situations and issue a safety alert when the situation is recognized.\nRecognition of situations of unsafe proximity may result from MSAW/E-MSAW, automatic altitude readouts, Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert, observations on a PAR scope, or pilot reports.\nOnce the alert is issued, it is solely the pilot's prerogative to determine what course of action, if any, will be taken.\nTerrain/Obstruction Alert. Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is at an altitude that, in your judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain and/or obstructions. Issue the alert as follows:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nLOW ALTITUDE ALERT (call sign),\nCHECK YOUR ALTITUDE IMMEDIATELY.\nand, if the aircraft is not yet on final approach,\nTHE (as appropriate) MEA/MVA/MOCA/MIA IN YOUR AREA IS (altitude).\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - FINAL APPROACH-IFR\nAircraft Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert. Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware of another aircraft at an altitude that you believe places them in unsafe proximity. If feasible, offer the pilot an alternate course of action. When an alternate course of action is given, end the transmission with the word “immediately.”\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTRAFFIC ALERT (call sign) (position of aircraft) ADVISE YOU TURN LEFT/RIGHT (heading),\nand/or\nCLIMB/DESCEND (specific altitude if appropriate) IMMEDIATELY.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Traffic Alert, Cessna Three Four Juliett, 12'o clock, 1 mile advise you turn left immediately.”\nor\n“Traffic Alert, Cessna Three-Four Juliett, 12'o clock, 1 mile advise you turn left and climb immediately.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-1, Conflict Alert (CA) and Mode C Intruder (MCI) Alert.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-2, En Route Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (E-MSAW).\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-14-6, CA/MCI.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-21, Altitude Filters.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nINFLIGHT EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS\nWhen a pilot reports an inflight equipment malfunction, determine the nature and extent of any special handling desired.\nNOTE-\nInflight equipment malfunctions include partial or complete failure of equipment, which may affect either safety, separation standards, and/or the ability of the flight to proceed under IFR, or in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace, in the ATC system. Controllers may expect reports from pilots regarding VOR, TACAN, ADF, GPS, RVSM capability, or low frequency navigation receivers, impairment of air-ground communications capability, or other equipment deemed appropriate by the pilot (e.g., airborne weather radar). Pilots should communicate the nature and extent of any assistance desired from ATC.\nProvide the maximum assistance possible consistent with equipment, workload, and any special handling requested.\nRelay to other controllers or facilities who will subsequently handle the aircraft, all pertinent details concerning the aircraft and any special handling required or being provided.\nMINIMUM FUEL\nIf an aircraft declares a state of “minimum fuel,” inform any facility to whom control jurisdiction is transferred of the minimum fuel problem and be alert for any occurrence which might delay the aircraft en route.\nNOTE-\nUse of the term “minimum fuel” indicates recognition by a pilot that his/her fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching destination, he/she cannot accept any undue delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely an advisory that indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur. A minimum fuel advisory does not imply a need for traffic priority. Common sense and good judgment will determine the extent of assistance to be given in minimum fuel situations. If, at any time, the remaining usable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing, the pilot should declare an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes.\nREPORTING ESSENTIAL FLIGHT INFORMATION\nReport as soon as possible to the appropriate FSS, airport manager's office, ARTCC, approach control facility, operations office, or military operations office any information concerning components of the NAS or any flight conditions which may have an adverse effect on air safety.\nNOTE-\nFSSs are responsible for classifying and disseminating Notices to Airmen.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-3, Timely Information.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-1-2, Periodic Maintenance.\nUSN, See OPNAVINST 3721.30.\nNAVAID MALFUNCTIONS\nWhen an aircraft reports a ground-based NAVAID malfunction, take the following actions:\nRequest a report from a second aircraft.\nIf the second aircraft reports normal operations, continue use and inform the first aircraft. Record the incident on FAA Form 7230-4 or appropriate military form.\nIf the second aircraft confirms the malfunction or in the absence of a second aircraft report, activate the standby equipment or request the monitor facility to activate.\nIf normal operation is reported after the standby equipment is activated, continue use, record the incident on FAA Form 7230-4 or appropriate military form, and notify technical operations personnel (the Systems Engineer of the ARTCC when an en route aid is involved).\nIf continued malfunction is reported after the standby equipment is activated or the standby equipment cannot be activated, inform technical operations personnel and request advice on whether or not the aid should be shut down. In the absence of a second aircraft report, advise the technical operations personnel of the time of the initial aircraft report and the estimated time a second aircraft report could be obtained.\nWhen an aircraft reports a GPS or WAAS anomaly, request the following information and/or take the following actions:\nRecord the following minimum information:\nAircraft make, model, and call sign.\nLocation or position, and altitude at the time where GPS or WAAS anomaly was observed.\nDate/time of occurrence.\nRequest a report from a second aircraft.\nRecord the incident on FAA Form 7230-4 or appropriate military form.\nInform other aircraft of the anomaly as specified in subparagraph 4-8-1k, l, or m, as applicable.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, GPS REPORTED UNRELIABLE (OR WAAS UNAVAILABLE) IN VICINITY/AREA (position).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft, GPS reported unreliable (or WAAS unavailable) in the area 30 miles south of Waco VOR.”\nWhen a pilot reports a WAAS anomaly, determine from the pilot what indications he or she observes and record the information in accordance with subparagraph b above.\nUSE OF MARSA\nMARSA may only be applied to military operations specified in a letter of agreement or other appropriate FAA or military document.\nNOTE-\nApplication of MARSA is a military command prerogative. It will not be invoked indiscriminately by individual units or pilots. It will be used only for IFR operations requiring its use. Commands authorizing MARSA will ensure that its implementation and terms of use are documented and coordinated with the control agency having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations are conducted. Terms of use will assign responsibility and provide for separation among participating aircraft.\nATC facilities do not invoke or deny MARSA. Their sole responsibility concerning the use of MARSA is to provide separation between military aircraft engaged in MARSA operations and other nonparticipating IFR aircraft.\nDoD must ensure that military pilots requesting special use airspace/ATCAAs have coordinated with the scheduling agency, have obtained approval for entry, and are familiar with the appropriate MARSA procedures. ATC is not responsible for determining which military aircraft are authorized to enter special use airspace/ATCAAs.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-13, Military Aerial Refueling.\nMILITARY PROCEDURES\nMilitary procedures in the form of additions, modifications, and exceptions to the basic FAA procedure are prescribed herein when a common procedure has not been attained or to fulfill a specific requirement. They must be applied by:\nATC facilities operated by that military service.\nEXAMPLE-\nAn Air Force facility providing service for an Air Force base would apply USAF procedures to all traffic regardless of class.\nA Navy facility providing service for a Naval Air Station would apply USN procedures to all traffic regardless of class.\nATC facilities, regardless of their parent organization (FAA, USAF, USN, USA), supporting a designated military airport exclusively. This designation determines which military procedures are to be applied.\nEXAMPLE-\nAn FAA facility supports a USAF base exclusively; USAF procedures are applied to all traffic at that base.\nAn FAA facility provides approach control service for a Naval Air Station as well as supporting a civil airport; basic FAA procedures are applied at both locations by the FAA facility.\nA USAF facility supports a USAF base and provides approach control service to a satellite civilian airport; USAF procedures are applied at both locations by the USAF facility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-2-5, Annotations.\nOther ATC facilities when specified in a letter of agreement.\nEXAMPLE-\nA USAF unit is using a civil airport supported by an FAA facility- USAF procedures will be applied as specified in a letter of agreement between the unit and the FAA facility to the aircraft of the USAF unit. Basic FAA procedures will be applied to all other aircraft.\nFORMATION FLIGHTS\nControl formation flights as a single aircraft. Separation responsibility between aircraft within the formation rests with the flight leader and the pilots of the other aircraft in the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are maneuvering to attain separation from each other to effect individual control during join-up and breakaway.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - FORMATION FLIGHT.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 3, Military Formation Flight.\nICAO Annex 2, 3.1.8 Formation Flights.\nSupport formation flight join-up for two aircraft when all of the following occur:\nRequested by any participating pilot.\nAll participating pilots concur.\nEither of the participating pilots reports the other/s in sight.\nEXAMPLE-\n“ROOK01 has EAGLE03 in sight, request formation join-up with EAGLE03 at flight level two zero zero. EAGLE03 will be the lead.”\n“EAGLE03 verify requesting flight join-up with ROOK01.”\nIf affirmative:\n“ROOK01 climb and maintain flight level two zero zero.  Report (advise) when formation join-up is complete.”\nIf multiple single aircraft request to join-up, multiple formations are joining as one, or aircraft are joining an established formation, obtain confirmation of required items listed in subparagraph 2-1-13a, from the lead aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - FORMATION FLIGHT.\nAfter join-up, aircraft beacon code assignment will be determined by formation type.\nFor a standard formation only the aircraft acting as the lead will squawk an ATC assigned beacon code. Ensure all other aircraft squawk standby.\nFor a nonstandard formation, each aircraft should squawk an ATC assigned beacon code.  Controller discretion allows aircraft in a nonstandard formation to squawk standby if operationally advantageous.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Para 7-3-6, Nonstandard Formation Tactics, Subpara b3.\nEXAMPLE-\n“N123JP squawk standby.”\nOr\n“N123SP have N123JP squawk standby.”\nWhen formation break-up is requested, issue control instructions and/or clearances which will result in approved separation through the lead or directly to the requesting aircraft in the formation.\nEXAMPLE-\n“N5871S requesting flight break-up with N731K. N731K is changing destination to PHL.”\n“N731K squawk 5432, turn right, fly heading zero-seven-zero.\n“Center, BAMA21. BAMA23 is requesting to RTB.”\n“BAMA21 have BAMA23 squawk 5544, descend and maintain flight level one-niner-zero and change to my frequency.”\n“Center, BAMA21. BAMA23 is requesting to RTB.”\n“BAMA23 squawk 5544. BAMA23 Radar contact (position if required). Cleared to SSC via direct. Descend and maintain flight level one-niner-zero.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-8, Additional Separation for Formation Flights.\nP/CG Term - FORMATION FLIGHT.\nMilitary and civil formation flights in RVSM airspace.\nUtilize RVSM separation standards for a formation flight, which consists of all RVSM approved aircraft.\nUtilize non-RVSM separation standards for a formation flight at or above FL 290, which does not consist of all RVSM approved aircraft.\nIf aircraft are requesting to form a formation flight to FL 290 or above, the controller who issues the clearance creating the formation flight is responsible for ensuring that the proper equipment suffix is entered for the lead aircraft.\nIf the flight departs as a formation, and is requesting FL 290 or above, the first center sector must ensure that the proper equipment suffix is entered.\nIf the formation flight is below FL 290 and later requests FL 290 or above, the controller receiving the RVSM altitude request must ensure the proper equipment suffix is entered.\nUpon break-up of the formation flight, the controller initiating the break-up must ensure that all aircraft or flights are assigned their proper equipment suffix.\nCOORDINATE USE OF AIRSPACE\nEnsure that the necessary coordination has been accomplished before you allow an aircraft under your control to enter another controller's area of jurisdiction.\nBefore you issue a control instruction directly to a pilot that will change the aircraft's heading, route, speed, or altitude, you must ensure that coordination has been completed with all controllers whose area of jurisdiction is affected by those instructions unless otherwise specified by a letter of agreement or facility directive. If your control instruction will be relayed to the pilot through a source other than another radar controller (FSS, New York Radio, San Francisco Radio, another pilot, etc.), you are still responsible to ensure that all required coordination is completed.\nNOTE-\nIt is good operating practice for controllers to confirm that required coordination has been/will be effected, especially in unusual circumstances, such as recently modified sector configurations, airspace changes, route changes, etc.\nEnsuring that all required coordination has been completed does not necessarily imply that the controller issuing the control instruction directly to the pilot has to perform the coordination action.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-15, Control Transfer.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-10, Adjacent Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-6, Receiving Controller Handoff.\nCONTROL TRANSFER\nTransfer control of an aircraft in accordance with the following conditions:\nAt a prescribed or coordinated location, time, fix, or altitude; or,\nAt the time a radar handoff and frequency change to the receiving controller have been completed and when authorized by a facility directive or letter of agreement which specifies the type and extent of control that is transferred.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-6, Receiving Controller Handoff.\nTransfer control of an aircraft only after eliminating any potential conflict with other aircraft for which you have separation responsibility.\nAssume control of an aircraft only after it is in your area of jurisdiction unless specifically coordinated or as specified by letter of agreement or a facility directive.\nSURFACE AREAS\nCoordinate with the appropriate nonapproach control tower on an individual aircraft basis before issuing a clearance which would require flight within a surface area for which the tower has responsibility unless otherwise specified in a letter of agreement.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-1, Letters of Agreement.\n14 CFR Section 91.127, Operating on or in the Vicinity of an Airport in Class E Airspace.\nP/CG Term - SURFACE AREA.\nCoordinate with the appropriate control tower for transit authorization when you are providing radar traffic advisory service to an aircraft that will enter another facility's airspace.\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is not expected to obtain his/her own authorization through each area when in contact with a radar facility.\nTransfer communications to the appropriate facility, if required, prior to operation within a surface area for which the tower has responsibility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-17, Radio Communications.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-11, Surface Area Restrictions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-6-1, Application.\n14 CFR Section 91.129, Operations in Class D Airspace.\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS\nTransfer radio communications before an aircraft enters the receiving controller's area of jurisdiction unless otherwise coordinated or specified by a letter of agreement or a facility directive.\nTransfer radio communications by specifying the following:\nNOTE-\nRadio communications transfer procedures may be specified by a letter of agreement or contained in the route description of an MTR as published in the DoD Planning AP/1B (AP/3).\nThe facility name or location name and terminal function to be contacted. TERMINAL:  Omit the location name when transferring communications to another controller within your facility, or, when the tower and TRACON share the same name (for example, Phoenix Tower and Phoenix TRACON).\nEXCEPTION. Controllers must include the name of the facility when instructing an aircraft to change frequency for final approach guidance.\nFrequency to use except the following may be omitted:\nFSS frequency.\nDeparture frequency if previously given or published on a SID chart for the procedure issued.\nTERMINAL:\nGround or local control frequency if in your opinion the pilot knows which frequency is in use.\nThe numbers preceding the decimal point if the ground control frequency is in the 121 MHz bandwidth.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Contact Tower.”\n“Contact Ground.”\n“Contact Ground Point Seven.”\n“Contact Ground, One Two Zero Point Eight.”\n“Contact Huntington Radio.”\n“Contact Departure.”\n“Contact Los Angeles Center, One Two Three Point Four.”\nTime, fix, altitude, or specifically when to contact a facility. You may omit this when compliance is expected upon receipt.\nNOTE-\nAIM, paragraph 5-3-1, ARTCC Communications, informs pilots that they are expected to maintain a listening watch on the transferring controller's frequency until the time, fix, or altitude specified.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCONTACT (facility name or location name and terminal function), (frequency).\nIf required,\nAT (time, fix, or altitude).\nControllers must, within a reasonable amount of time, take appropriate action to establish/restore communications with all aircraft for which a communications transfer or initial contact to his/her sector is expected/required.\nNOTE-\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, a reasonable amount of time is considered to be 5 minutes from the time the aircraft enters the controller's area of jurisdiction or comes within range of radio/communications coverage. Communications include two-way VHF or UHF radio contact, data link, or high frequency (HF) radio through an approved third-party provider such as New York Radio or San Francisco Radio.\nERAM facilities, beginning with initial audio contact with an aircraft, must utilize the voice communication indicator to reflect the current status of voice communications.\nIn situations where an operational advantage will be gained, and following coordination with the receiving controller, you may instruct aircraft on the ground to monitor the receiving controller's frequency.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Monitor Tower.”\n“Monitor Ground.”\n“Monitor Ground Point Seven.”\n“Monitor Ground, One Two Zero Point Eight.”\nIn situations where a sector has multiple frequencies or when sectors are combined using multiple frequencies and the aircraft will remain under your jurisdiction, transfer radio communication by specifying the following:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification) CHANGE TO MY FREQUENCY (state frequency).\nEXAMPLE-\n“United two twenty‐two change to my frequency one two three point four.”\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 4-2-3, Contact Procedures.\nAvoid issuing a frequency change to helicopters known to be single‐piloted during air‐taxiing, hovering, or low‐level flight. Whenever possible, relay necessary control instructions until the pilot is able to change frequency.\nNOTE-\nMost light helicopters are flown by one pilot and require the constant use of both hands and feet to maintain control. Although Flight Control Friction Devices assist the pilot, changing frequency near the ground could result in inadvertent ground contact and consequent loss of control. Pilots are expected to advise ATC of their single‐pilot status if unable to comply with a frequency change.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 4-3-14, Communications.\nIn situations where the controller does not want the pilot to change frequency but the pilot is expecting or may want a frequency change, use the following phraseology.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREMAIN THIS FREQUENCY.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-1, Clearance Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-12-9, Communication Transfer.\nOPERATIONAL REQUESTS\nRespond to a request from another controller, a pilot or vehicle operator by one of the following verbal means:\nRestate the request in complete or abbreviated terms followed by the word “APPROVED.” The phraseology “APPROVED AS REQUESTED” may be substituted in lieu of a lengthy readback.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Requested operation) APPROVED.\nor\nAPPROVED AS REQUESTED.\nState restrictions followed by the word “APPROVED.”\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Restriction and/or additional instructions, requested operation) APPROVED.\nState the word “UNABLE” and, time permitting, a reason.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNABLE (requested operation).\nand when necessary,\n(reason and/or additional instructions.)\nState the words “STAND BY.”\nNOTE-\n“STAND BY\" is not an approval or denial. The controller acknowledges the request and will respond at a later time.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-9-3, Methods.\nWAKE TURBULENCE\nApply wake turbulence procedures to an aircraft operating behind another aircraft when wake turbulence separation is required.\nNOTE-\nParagraph 5-5-4, Minima, subparagraphs f and g specify the required radar wake turbulence separations.  Time-based separations are contained in paragraph 3-9-6, Same Runway Separation, paragraph 3-9-7, Wake Turbulence Separation for Intersection Departures, paragraph 3-9-8, Intersecting Runway Separation, paragraph 3-9-9, Nonintersecting Converging Runway Operations, paragraph 3-10-3, Same Runway Separation, paragraph 3-10-4, Intersecting Runway Separation, paragraph 6-1-4, Adjacent Airport Operation, paragraph 6-1-5, Arrival Minima, and paragraph 6-7-5, Interval Minima.\nThe separation minima must continue to touchdown for all IFR aircraft not making a visual approach or maintaining visual separation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-5, Approach Separation Responsibility.\nWAKE TURBULENCE CAUTIONARY ADVISORIES\nIssue wake turbulence cautionary advisories including the position, altitude if known, and direction of flight to aircraft operating behind an aircraft that requires wake turbulence separation when:\nREFERENCE-\nAC 90-23, Aircraft Wake Turbulence, Pilot Responsibility, Para 11.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-4, Minima, subpara f.\nTERMINAL.

VFR arriving aircraft that have previously been radar vectored and the vectoring has been discontinued.\nIssue cautionary information to any aircraft if in your opinion, wake turbulence may have an adverse effect on it. When traffic is known to be a Super aircraft, include the word Super in the description. When traffic is known to be a Heavy aircraft, include the word Heavy in the description.\nNOTE-\nWake turbulence is generated when an aircraft produces lift. Because the location of wake turbulence is difficult to determine, the controller is not responsible for anticipating its existence or effect. Aircraft flying through a Super/Heavy aircraft's flight path may have an increased chance of a wake encounter.\nREFERENCE-\nAC 90-23, Aircraft Wake Turbulence.\nP/CG Term - AIRCRAFT CLASSES.\nP/CG Term - WAKE TURBULENCE.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE (traffic information).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nTRAFFIC ADVISORIES\nUnless an aircraft is operating within Class A airspace or omission is requested by the pilot, issue traffic advisories to all aircraft (IFR or VFR) on your frequency when, in your judgment, their proximity may diminish to less than the applicable separation minima. Where no separation minima applies, such as for VFR aircraft outside of Class B/Class C airspace, or a TRSA, issue traffic advisories to those aircraft on your frequency when in your judgment their proximity warrants it. Provide this service as follows:\nTo radar identified aircraft:\nAzimuth from aircraft in terms of the 12-hour clock, or\nWhen rapidly maneuvering aircraft prevent accurate issuance of traffic as in 1 above, specify the direction from an aircraft's position in terms of the eight cardinal compass points (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW). This method must be terminated at the pilot's request.\nDistance from aircraft in miles.\nDirection in which traffic is proceeding and/or relative movement of traffic.\nNOTE-\nRelative movement includes closing, converging, parallel same direction, opposite direction, diverging, overtaking, crossing left to right, crossing right to left.\nIf known, type of aircraft and altitude.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-21, Description of Aircraft Types.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTRAFFIC, (number) O'CLOCK,\nor when appropriate,\n(direction) (number) MILES, (direction)-BOUND and/or (relative movement),\nand if known,\n(type of aircraft and altitude).\nor\nWhen appropriate,\n(type of aircraft and relative position), (number of feet) FEET ABOVE/BELOW YOU.\nIf altitude is unknown,\nALTITUDE UNKNOWN.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Traffic, eleven o'clock, one zero miles, southbound, converging, Boeing Seven Twenty Seven, one seven thousand.”\n“Traffic, twelve o'clock, one five miles, opposite direction, altitude unknown.”\n“Traffic, ten o'clock, one two miles, southeast bound, one thousand feet below you.”\nWhen requested by the pilot, issue radar vectors to assist in avoiding the traffic, provided the aircraft to be vectored is within your area of jurisdiction or coordination has been effected with the sector/facility in whose area the aircraft is operating.

If known, include position, distance, course, type of unmanned aircraft (UA), and altitude.\nEXAMPLE-\n“U-A-S activity, 12 o'clock, 1 mile, southbound, quad copter, 400 feet and below.”\n“Unmanned aircraft system activity, 2 miles east of Brandywine Airport, 300 feet and below.”\nIssue UAS advisory information for pilot-reported or tower-observed activity, when in your judgment, their proximity warrants it. If known, include position, altitude, course, and type. Continue to issue advisories to potentially impacted aircraft for at least 15 minutes following the last report.\nEXAMPLE-\n“U-A-S activity reported, 12 o'clock, 1 mile, altitude reported one thousand two hundred.”\n“Unmanned aircraft system activity observed, 1 mile east of Trenton Airport, altitude unknown.”\nBIRD ACTIVITY INFORMATION\nIssue advisory information on pilot‐reported, tower‐observed, or radar‐observed and pilot‐verified bird activity. Include position, species or size of birds, if known, course of flight, and altitude. Do this for at least 15 minutes after receipt of such information from pilots or from adjacent facilities unless visual observation or subsequent reports reveal the activity is no longer a factor.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Flock of geese, one o'clock, seven miles, northbound, last reported at four thousand.”\n“Flock of small birds, southbound along Mohawk River, last reported at three thousand.”\n“Numerous flocks of ducks, vicinity Lake Winnebago, altitude unknown.”\nRelay bird activity information to adjacent facilities and to FSSs whenever it appears it will become a factor in their areas.\nTRANSFER OF POSITION RESPONSIBILITY\nThe transfer of position responsibility must be accomplished in accordance with the “Standard Operating Practice (SOP) for the Transfer of Position Responsibility,” and appropriate facility directives each time operational responsibility for a position is transferred from one specialist to another.\nWHEELS DOWN CHECK\nUSA/USN\nRemind aircraft to check wheels down on each approach unless the pilot has previously reported wheels down for that approach.\nNOTE-\nThe intent is solely to remind the pilot to lower the wheels, not to place responsibility on the controller.\nTower must issue the wheels down check at an appropriate place in the pattern.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCHECK WHEELS DOWN.\nApproach/arrival control, GCA must issue the wheels down check as follows:\nTo aircraft conducting ASR, PAR, or radar monitored approaches, before the aircraft starts descent on final approach.\nTo aircraft conducting instrument approaches and remaining on the radar facility's frequency, before the aircraft passes the outer marker/final approach fix.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nWHEELS SHOULD BE DOWN.\nSUPERVISORY NOTIFICATION\nEnsure supervisor/controller‐in‐charge (CIC) is aware of conditions which impact sector/position operations including, but not limited to, the following:\nWeather.\nEquipment status.\nPotential sector overload.\nEmergency situations.\nSpecial flights/operations.\nAircraft/pilot activity, including unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operation that is considered suspicious, as prescribed in FAA Order JO 7610.4, paragraph 7-3-1, and for information more specific to UAS, FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 2-1-34.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - SUSPICIOUS UAS.\nPOSSIBLE PILOT DEVIATION NOTIFICATION\nWhen it appears that the actions of a pilot constitute a pilot deviation, notify the pilot, workload permitting.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification) POSSIBLE PILOT DEVIATION ADVISE YOU CONTACT (facility) AT (telephone number).\nNOTE-\nThe phraseology example identified in this paragraph is commonly referred to as the “Brasher Notification” or “Brasher Warning,” which gives flight crews the opportunity to make note of the occurrence for future reference. The use of these terms during direct pilot communications is not appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 8020.16, Air Traffic Organization Aircraft Accident and Aircraft Incident Notification, Investigation, and Reporting, Chapter 12, Para 3, Air Traffic Facility Responsibilities.\nTCAS RESOLUTION ADVISORIES\nWhen an aircraft under your control jurisdiction informs you that it is responding to a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA), do not issue control instructions that are contrary to the RA procedure that a crew member has advised you that they are executing. Provide safety alerts regarding terrain or obstructions and traffic advisories for the aircraft responding to the RA and all other aircraft under your control jurisdiction, as appropriate.\nUnless advised by other aircraft that they are also responding to a TCAS RA, do not assume that other aircraft in the proximity of the responding aircraft are involved in the RA maneuver or are aware of the responding aircraft's intended maneuvers. Continue to provide control instructions, safety alerts, and traffic advisories as appropriate to such aircraft.\nNOTE-\nWhen notified by the pilot of an RA, the controller is not prohibited from issuing traffic advisories and safety alerts.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nOnce the responding aircraft has begun a maneuver in response to an RA, the controller is not responsible for providing approved separation between the aircraft that is responding to an RA and any other aircraft, airspace, terrain or obstructions. Responsibility for approved separation resumes when one of the following conditions is met:\nThe responding aircraft has returned to its assigned altitude, or\nA crew member informs you that the TCAS maneuver is completed and you observe that approved separation has been reestablished, or\nThe responding aircraft has executed an alternate clearance and you observe that approved separation has been reestablished.\nNOTE-\nAC 120-55, Air Carrier Operational Approval and Use of TCAS II, suggests pilots use the following phraseology to notify controllers during TCAS events. When a TCAS RA may affect an ATC clearance, inform ATC when beginning the maneuver, or as soon as workload permits.\nEXAMPLE-\n“New York Center, United 321, TCAS RA.”\nNOTE-\nWhen the RA has been resolved, the flight crew should advise ATC they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or subsequent amended clearance.\nEXAMPLE-\n“New York Center, United 321, clear of conflict, returning to assigned altitude.”\nRVSM OPERATIONS\nRVSM operations are conducted in RVSM airspace that is defined as any airspace between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive, where eligible aircraft are separated vertically by 1,000 feet. Controller responsibilities must include but not be limited to the following:\nNon‐RVSM aircraft operating in RVSM airspace.\nEnsure non-RVSM aircraft are not permitted in RVSM airspace unless they meet the criteria of excepted aircraft and are previously approved by the operations supervisor/CIC. The following aircraft are excepted: DoD, DoD-certified aircraft operated by NASA (T38, F15, F18, WB57, S3, and U2 aircraft only), MEDEVAC, manufacturer aircraft being flown for development/certification, and Foreign State aircraft. These exceptions are accommodated on a workload or traffic-permitting basis.\nNOTE-\nThe operations supervisor/CIC is responsible for system acceptance of a non‐RVSM aircraft beyond the initial sector‐to‐sector coordination following the pilot request to access the airspace. Operations supervisor/CIC responsibilities are defined in FAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 6, Section 8, Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM).\nEnsure sector‐to‐sector coordination for all non‐RVSM aircraft operations within RVSM airspace.\nInform the operations supervisor/CIC when a non‐RVSM exception flight is denied clearance into RVSM airspace or is removed from RVSM airspace.\nNon-RVSM aircraft transitioning RVSM airspace.\nEnsure that operations supervisors/CICs are made aware when non‐RVSM aircraft are transitioning through RVSM airspace.\nApply appropriate separation standards and remove any aircraft from RVSM airspace that advises it is unable RVSM due to equipment while en route.\nUse “negative RVSM\" in all verbal ground‐to‐ground communications involving non‐RVSM aircraft while cleared to operate within RVSM airspace.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Point out Baxter1 climbing to FL 360, negative RVSM.”\nFor the following situations, use the associated phraseology:\nTo deny clearance into RVSM airspace.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“UNABLE CLEARANCE INTO RVSM AIRSPACE.”\nTo request a pilot to report when able to resume RVSM.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“REPORT ABLE TO RESUME RVSM.”\nIn the event of a change to an aircraft's RVSM eligibility, amend the RVSM qualifier (“W”) in the ICAO equipment string in order to properly identify non‐RVSM aircraft on the controller display.\nNOTE-\nChanging the equipment suffix instead of amending the equipment string may result in incorrect revisions to other ICAO qualifiers.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 5-1-9, International Flight Plan (FAA Form 7233-4) IFR Flights (For Domestic or International Flights).\nAIM, TBL 5-1-4, Aircraft COM, NAV, and Approach Equipment Qualifiers.\nATC may allow aircraft to remain in RVSM airspace using reduced vertical separation minima after the loss of a transponder or Mode C altitude reporting.\nNOTE-\nIn a transponder out situation, the aircraft's altitude‐keeping capabilities required for flight in RVSM airspace should remain operational.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-1, Vertical Separation Minima.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-8, Aircraft Equipment Suffix.\n14 CFR Section 91.215, ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use.\nAdvisory Circular AC 91-85B, Authorization of Aircraft and Operators for Flight in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace.\nTERRAIN AWARENESS WARNING SYSTEM (TAWS) ALERTS\nWhen an aircraft under your control jurisdiction informs you that it is responding to a TAWS (or other on‐board low altitude) alert, do not issue control instructions that are contrary to the TAWS procedure that a crew member has advised you that they are executing. Provide safety alerts regarding terrain or obstructions and traffic advisories for the aircraft responding to the TAWS alert and all other aircraft under your control jurisdiction, as appropriate.\nOnce the responding aircraft has begun a maneuver in response to TAWS alert, the controller is not responsible for providing approved separation between the aircraft that is responding to a TAWS alert and any other aircraft, airspace, terrain or obstructions. Responsibility for approved separation resumes when one of the following conditions is met:\nThe responding aircraft has returned to its assigned altitude, or\nA crew member informs you that the TAWS maneuver is completed and you observe that approved separation has been reestablished, or\nThe responding aircraft has executed an alternate clearance and you observe that approved separation has been reestablished.\n“BLUE LIGHTNING” EVENTS\nEnsure that the supervisor/controller‐in‐charge (CIC) is notified of reports of possible human trafficking. These may be referred to as “Blue Lightning” events.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Flight Plans and Control InformationRECORDING INFORMATION\nRecord flight plan information required by the type of flight plan and existing circumstances. Use authorized abbreviations when possible.\nNOTE-\nGenerally, all military overseas flights are required to clear through a specified military base operations office (BASOPS). Pilots normally will not file flight plans directly with an FAA facility unless a BASOPS is not available. BASOPS will, in turn, forward the IFR flight notification message to the appropriate center.\nEN ROUTE. When flight plans are filed directly with the center, record all items given by the pilot either on a flight progress strip/flight data entry or on a voice recorder. If the latter, enter in box 26 of the initial flight progress strip the sector or position number to identify where the information may be found in the event search and rescue (SAR) activities become necessary.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFORWARDING INFORMATION\nExcept during EAS FDP operation, forward the flight plan information to the appropriate ATC facility, FSS, or BASOPS and record the time of filing and delivery on the form.\nEN ROUTE. During EAS FDP operation, the above manual actions are required in cases where the data is not forwarded automatically by the computer.\nNOTE-\nDuring EAS FDP operation, data is exchanged between interfaced automated facilities and both the data and time of transmission are recorded automatically.\nEN ROUTE. Forward proposed tower en route flight plans and any related amendments to the appropriate departure terminal facility.\nFORWARDING VFR DATA\nTERMINAL\nForward aircraft departure times to FSSs or military operations offices when they have requested them. Forward other VFR flight plan data only if requested by the pilot.\nMILITARY DVFR DEPARTURES\nTERMINAL\nForward departure times on all DVFR departures from joint-use airports to the military operations office.\nNOTE-\nDetails for handling air carrier and nonscheduled civil DVFR flight data are contained in FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations.\nCivil pilots departing DVFR from a joint-use airport will include the phrase “DVFR to (destination)” in their initial call-up to an FAA-operated tower.\nIFR TO VFR FLIGHT PLAN CHANGE\nRequest a pilot to contact the appropriate FSS if the pilot informs you of a desire to change from an IFR to a VFR flight plan.\nIFR FLIGHT PROGRESS DATA\nForward control information from controller to controller within a facility, then to the receiving facility as the aircraft progresses along its route. Where appropriate, use computer equipment in lieu of manual coordination procedures. Do not use the remarks section of flight progress strips in lieu of voice coordination to pass control information. Ensure that flight plan and control information is correct and up‐to‐date. When covered by a letter of agreement/facility directive, the time requirements of subparagraph a may be reduced, and the time requirements of subparagraph b1 and paragraph 2-2-11, Forwarding Amended and UTM Data, subparagraph a may be increased up to 15 minutes when facilitated by automated systems or mandatory radar handoffs; or if operationally necessary because of manual data processing or nonradar operations, the time requirements of subparagraph a may be increased.\nNOTE-\nThe procedures for preparing flight plan and control information related to altitude reservations (ALTRVs) are contained in FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 8-1-2, Facility Operation and Administration, ALTRV Flight Data Processing. Development of the methods for assuring the accuracy and completeness of ALTRV flight plan and control information is the responsibility of the military liaison and security officer.\nThe term facility in this paragraph refers to centers and terminal facilities when operating in an en route capacity.\nForward the following information at least 15 minutes before the aircraft is estimated to enter the receiving facility's area:\nAircraft identification.\nNumber of aircraft if more than one, heavy aircraft indicator “H/” if appropriate, type of aircraft, and aircraft equipment suffix.\nAssigned altitude and ETA over last reporting point/fix in transferring facility's area or assumed departure time when the departure point is the last point/fix in the transferring facility's area.\nAltitude at which aircraft will enter the receiving facility's area if other than the assigned altitude.\nTrue airspeed.\nPoint of departure.\nRoute of flight remaining.\nDestination airport and clearance limit if other than destination airport.\nETA at destination airport (not required for military or scheduled air carrier aircraft).\nAltitude requested by the aircraft if assigned altitude differs from requested altitude (within a facility only).\nNOTE-\nWhen an aircraft has crossed one facility's area and assignment at a different altitude is still desired, the pilot will reinitiate the request with the next facility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-8, Anticipated Altitude Changes.\nWhen flight plan data must be forwarded manually and an aircraft has been assigned a beacon code by the computer, include the code as part of the flight plan.\nNOTE-\nWhen an airborne aircraft that has been assigned a beacon code by the ARTCC computer and whose flight plan will terminate in another facility's area cancels ATC service, appropriate action should be taken to remove flight plan information on that aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-11, Forwarding Amended and UTM Data.\nLongitudinal separation being used in nonradar operations between aircraft at the same altitude if it results in these aircraft having less than 10 minutes separation at the facilities' boundary, unless (otherwise) specified in a Letter of Agreement (LOA).\nAny additional nonroutine operational information pertinent to flight safety.\nNOTE-\nEN ROUTE. This includes alerting the receiving controller that the flight is conducting celestial navigation training.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-2, Celestial Navigation Training.\nForward position report over last reporting point in the transferring facility's area if any of the following conditions exist:\nTime differs more than 3 minutes from estimate given.\nRequested by receiving facility.\nAgreed to between facilities.\nMANUAL INPUT OF COMPUTER‐ASSIGNED BEACON CODES\nWhen a flight plan is manually entered into the computer and a computer‐assigned beacon code has been forwarded with the flight plan data, insert the beacon code in the appropriate field as part of the input message.\nALTRV INFORMATION\nEN ROUTE\nWhen an aircraft is a part of an approved ALTRV, forward only those items necessary to properly identify the flight, update flight data contained in the ALTRV APVL, or revise previously given information.\nCOMPUTER MESSAGE VERIFICATION\nEN ROUTE\nUnless your facility is equipped to automatically obtain acknowledgment of receipt of transferred data, when you transfer control information by computer message, obtain, via Service F, acknowledgment that the receiving center has received the message and verification of the following:\nWithin the time limits specified by a letter of agreement or when not covered by a letter of agreement, at least 15 minutes before the aircraft is estimated to enter the receiving facility's area, or at the time of a radar handoff, or coordination for transfer of control:\nAircraft identification.\nAssigned altitude.\nDeparture or coordination fix time.\nAny cancellation of IFR or EAS generated VFR flight plan.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data.\nTRANSMIT PROPOSED FLIGHT PLAN\nEN ROUTE\nTransmit proposed flight plans which fall within an ARTCC's Proposed Boundary Crossing Time (PBCT) parameter to adjacent ARTCC's via the Computer B network during hours of inter‐center computer operation. In addition, when the route of flight of any proposed flight plan exceeds 20 elements external to the originating ARTCC's area, NADIN must be used to forward the data to all affected centers.\nDuring nonautomated operation, the proposed flight plans must be sent via NADIN to the other centers involved when any of the following conditions are met:\nThe route of flight external to the originating center's area consists of 10 or more elements and the flight will enter 3 or more other center areas.\nNOTE-\nAn element is defined as either a fix or route as specified in FAA Order JO 7110.10, Flight Services, paragraph 6-2-3, Control Messages.\nThe route of flight beyond the first point of exit from the originating center's area consists of 10 or more elements, which are primarily fixes described in fix‐radial‐distance or latitude/longitude format, regardless of the number of other center areas entered.\nThe flight plan remarks are too lengthy for interphone transmission.\nFORWARDING AMENDED AND UTM DATA\nForward any amending data concerning previously forwarded flight plans except that revisions to ETA information in paragraph 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data, need only be forwarded when the time differs by more than 3 minutes from the estimate given.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification), REVISED (revised information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Two, revised flight level, three three zero.”\n“United Eight Ten, revised estimate, Front Royal two zero zero five.”\n“Douglas Five Zero One Romeo, revised altitude, eight thousand.”\n“U.S. Air Eleven Fifty-one, revised type, heavy Boeing Seven Sixty‐seven.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data.\nComputer acceptance of an appropriate input message fulfills the requirement for sending amended data. During EAS FDP operations, the amendment data are considered acknowledged on receipt of a computer update message or a computer-generated flight progress strip containing the amended data.\nNOTE-\nThe successful utilization of automation equipment requires timely and accurate insertion of changes and/or new data.\nIf a pilot is not issued a computer‐generated ADR/ADAR/AAR and if amendment data is not entered into the computer, the next controller will have incorrect route information.\nForward any amended control information and record the action on the appropriate flight progress strip. Additionally, when a route or altitude in a previously issued clearance is amended within 30 minutes of an aircraft's proposed departure time, the facility that amended the clearance must coordinate the amendment with the receiving facility via verbal AND automated means to ensure timely passage of the information. If the automated means of coordination are unavailable, then verbal coordination is sufficient.\nNOTE-\nThe term “receiving” facility means the ATC facility that is expected to transmit the amended clearance to the intended aircraft/pilot.\nEN ROUTE. Effect manual coordination on any interfacility flight plan data that is not passed through automated means.\nEN ROUTE. When a controller receives a UTM notification to an FDIO only facility, they must effect manual coordination for the flight plan data.  In addition, the controller must verify the flight plan data to the receiving facility within three minutes of the transfer of control point estimate.\nNOTE-\nFDIO only facilities are facilities with FDIO but without STARS.\nAIRBORNE MILITARY FLIGHTS\nForward to FSSs the following information received from airborne military aircraft:\nIFR flight plans and changes from VFR to IFR flight plans.\nChanges to an IFR flight plan as follows:\nChange in destination:\nAircraft identification and type.\nDeparture point.\nOriginal destination.\nPosition and time.\nNew destination.\nETA.\nRemarks including change in fuel exhaustion time.\nRevised ETA.\nChange in fuel exhaustion time.\nNOTE-\nThis makes current information available to FSSs for relay to military bases concerned and for use by centers in the event of two-way radio communications failure.\nFORWARDING FLIGHT PLAN DATA BETWEEN U.S. ARTCCs AND CANADIAN ACCs\nEN ROUTE\nDomestic. (Continental U.S./Canadian airspace except Alaska) Proposed departure flight plans and en route estimates will be handled on a 30 minute lead time (or as bilaterally agreed) between any ACC and ARTCC.\nInternational. Any route changes (except SIDs) must be forwarded to the appropriate Oceanic/Pre‐oceanic ACC or ARTCC with an optimum lead time of 30 minutes or as soon as this information becomes available.\nInitially, if a flight goes from U.S. airspace into Canadian airspace and returns to U.S. airspace, the ACC will be responsible for forwarding the flight plan data to the appropriate ARTCC by voice transmission except for flights which traverse mutually agreed on airways/fixes. These airways/fixes will be determined on a case‐by‐case basis and will be based on time and distance considerations at the service area office.\nTELETYPE FLIGHT DATA FORMAT- U.S. ARTCCs - CANADIAN ACCs\nEN ROUTE\nThe exchange of flight plan data between Canadian ACCs and U.S. ARTCCs must be made as follows:\nThe U.S. ARTCCs will transmit flight data to the Canadian ACCs in one of the following formats:\nNADIN II input format as described in the NAS Management Directives (MDs) for:\nFlight Plan Messages:\nActive.\nProposed.\nAmendment messages.\nCancellation messages.\nResponse Messages to Canadian Input:\nAcknowledgment messages.\nError messages.\nRejection messages.\nTransport Canada (TC) ACC Flight Strip Format: Where the data to be printed on the ACC strip form exceeds the strip form field size, the NADIN II input format in 1 above will be used. Input sequentially fields 1 through 8 in paragraph 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data, subparagraph a.\nTC's ACCs will transmit flight data to the FAA ARTCCs in the following format:\nNADIN II input format as described in NAS MDs for:\nFlight Plan Messages:\nActive.\nProposed.\nAmendment messages.\nCancellation messages.\nCorrection messages.\nNORTH AMERICAN ROUTE PROGRAM (NRP) INFORMATION\n“NRP” must be retained in the remarks section of the flight plan if the aircraft is moved due to weather, traffic, or other tactical reasons.\nNOTE-\nEvery effort should be made to ensure the aircraft is returned to the original filed flight plan/altitude as soon as conditions warrant.\nIf the route of flight is altered due to a pilot request, “NRP” must be removed from the remarks section of the flight plan.\n“NRP” must not be entered in the remarks section of a flight plan, unless prior coordination is accomplished with the ATCSCC or as prescribed by international NRP flight operations procedures.\nThe en route facility within which an international flight entering the conterminous U.S. requests to participate in the NRP must enter “NRP” in the remarks section of the flight plan.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 18, Section 17, North American Route Program.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Flight Progress StripsGENERAL\nUnless otherwise authorized in a facility directive, use flight progress strips to post current data on air traffic and clearances required for control and other air traffic control services. To prevent misinterpretation when data is hand printed, use standard hand‐printed characters.\nEn route: Flight progress strips must be posted.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 6-1-6, Flight Progress Strip Usage.\nMaintain only necessary current data and remove the strips from the flight progress boards when no longer required for control purposes. To correct, update, or preplan information:\nDo not erase or overwrite any item. Use an “X” to delete a climb/descend and maintain arrow, an at or above/below symbol, a cruise symbol, and unwanted altitude information. Write the new altitude information immediately adjacent to it and within the same space.\nDo not draw a horizontal line through an altitude being vacated until after the aircraft has reported or is observed (valid Mode C) leaving the altitude.\nPreplanning may be accomplished in red pencil.\nManually prepared strips must conform to the format of machine‐generated strips and manual strip preparation procedures will be modified simultaneously with the operational implementation of changes in the machine‐generated format. (See FIG 2-3-1.)\nAltitude information may be written in thousands of feet provided the procedure is authorized by the facility manager, and is defined in a facility directive, i.e., 5,000 feet as 5, and 2,800 as 2.8.\nNOTE-\nA slant line crossing through the number zero and underline of the letter “s” on handwritten portions of flight progress strips are required only when there is reason to believe the lack of these markings could lead to misunderstanding. A slant line crossing through the number zero is required on all weather data.\nFIG 2-3-1Standard Recording of Hand‐printed Characters\nEN ROUTE DATA ENTRIES\nFIG 2-3-2Flight Progress Strip\n(7230-19)\nInformation recorded on the flight progress strips (FAA Forms 7230-19) must be entered in the correspondingly numbered spaces:\nTBL 2-3-1\nBlock\nInformation Recorded\n1.\nVerification symbol if required.\n2.\nRevision number.\nDSR-Not used.\n3.\nAircraft identification.\n4.\nNumber of aircraft if more than one, heavy aircraft indicator “H/” if appropriate, type of aircraft, and aircraft equipment suffix.\n5.\nFiled true airspeed.\n6.\nSector number.\n7.\nComputer identification number if required.\n8.\nEstimated ground speed.\n9.\nRevised ground speed or strip request (SR) originator.\n10.\nStrip number.\nDSR- Strip number/Revision number.\n11.\nPrevious fix.\n12.\nEstimated time over previous fix.\n13.\nRevised estimated time over previous fix.\n14.\nActual time over previous fix, or actual departure time entered on first fix posting after departure.\n14a.\nPlus time expressed in minutes from the previous fix to the posted fix.\n15.\nCenter-estimated time over fix (in hours and minutes), or clearance information for departing aircraft.\n16.\nArrows to indicate if aircraft is departing (↑) or arriving (↓).\n17.\nPilot-estimated time over fix.\n18.\nActual time over fix, time leaving holding fix, arrival time at nonapproach control airport, or symbol indicating cancellation of IFR flight plan for arriving aircraft, or departure time (actual or assumed).\n19.\nFix.

Approved special use identifiers.\nAIRCRAFT TYPE\nUse the approved aircraft type designator, in accordance with FAA Order 7360.1, Aircraft Type Designators.\nUSAF/USN UNDERGRADUATE PILOTS\nTo identify aircraft piloted by solo USAF/USN undergraduate student pilots (who may occasionally request revised clearances because they normally are restricted to flight in VFR conditions), the aircraft identification in the flight plan must include the letter “Z” as a suffix. Do not use this suffix, however, in ground‐to‐air communication.\nNOTE-\nUSAF solo students who have passed an instrument certification check may penetrate cloud layers in climb or descent only. Requests for revised clearances to avoid clouds in level flight can still be expected. This does not change the requirement to use the letter “Z” as a suffix to the aircraft identification.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 2, USAF Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT)/Pilot Instructor Training (PIT)/Introduction To Fighter Fundamentals.\nAIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT SUFFIX\nThe aircraft equipment suffix identifying communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) capability is generated by automation using the equipment codes of the ICAO flight plan. To change a suffix, the CNS equipment codes must be modified, allowing automation to translate them into the proper suffix. If using unsupported automation platforms (OFDPS and FDP2000), verbally coordinate changes with adjacent supported facilities.\nERAM and ATOP are best suited for making changes to the equipment codes in an ICAO flight plan. For FDIO entries, if uncertain of the proper format to correctly amend an equipment code, verbally coordinate the change with the appropriate en route facility.\nNOTE-\nDirectly changing the equipment suffix with a symbol preceded by a slant instead of amending the aircraft equipment codes may unintentionally alter or delete other equipment codes.\nFor VFR operations, indicate the aircraft's transponder and navigation capabilities by adding the appropriate symbol, preceded by a slant (See TBL 2-3-10).\nGNSS-equipped aircraft:\nHave an equipment suffix of /G, /L, /S, or /V.\nMay be determined by executing an ICAO flight plan readout and verifying a filed “G” in the ICAO equipment list.\nMay be determined by verifying with the pilot that the aircraft is GNSS-equipped.\nWhen forwarding this information, state the aircraft type followed by the word “slant” and the appropriate phonetic letter equivalent of the suffix.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cessna Three-ten slant Tango.”\n“A-Ten slant November.”\n“F-Sixteen slant Papa.”\n“Seven-sixty-seven slant Golf.”\nNOTE-\n/H and /O are intended for ATC use only. These suffixes are not published in the Aeronautical Information Manual.\nCLEARANCE STATUS\nUse an appropriate clearance symbol followed by a dash (-) and other pertinent information to clearly show the clearance status of an aircraft. To indicate delay status use:\nThe symbol “H” at the clearance limit when holding instructions have been included in the aircraft's original clearance. Show detailed holding information following the dash when holding differs from the established pattern for the fix; i.e., turns, leg lengths, etc.\nThe symbols “F” or “O” to indicate the clearance limit when a delay is not anticipated.\nTBL 2-3-10Aircraft Equipment Suffixes\nSeparation Standard\nNavigation Capability\nTransponder Capability\nSuffix\nRVSM\nAny\nFailed transponder\n/H\nAny\nFailed Mode C\n/O\nNo RNAV, No GNSS\nTransponder with Mode C\n/W\nRNAV, No GNSS\nTransponder with Mode C\n/Z\nGNSS\nTransponder with Mode C\n/L\nNon-RVSM\nNo DME\nNo transponder\n/X\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/T\nTransponder with Mode C\n/U\nDME\nNo transponder\n/D\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/B\nTransponder with Mode C\n/A\nTACAN\nNo transponder\n/M\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/N\nTransponder with Mode C\n/P\nRNAV,\nNo GNSS\nNo transponder\n/Y\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/C\nTransponder with Mode C\n/I\nGNSS\nNo transponder\n/V\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/S\nTransponder with Mode C\n/G\nCONTROL SYMBOLOGY\nUse authorized control and clearance symbols or abbreviations for recording clearances, reports, and instructions.

Radio and Interphone CommunicationsRADIO COMMUNICATIONS\nUse radio frequencies for the special purposes for which they are intended. A single frequency may be used for more than one function except as follows:\nTERMINAL. When combining positions in the tower, do not use ground control frequency for airborne communications.\nNOTE-\nDue to the limited number of frequencies assigned to towers for the ground control function, it is very likely that airborne use of a ground control frequency could cause interference to other towers or interference to your aircraft from another tower. When combining these functions, it is recommended combining them on local control. The ATIS may be used to specify the desired frequency.\nMONITORING\nMonitor interphones and assigned radio frequencies continuously.\nNOTE-\nAlthough all FAA facilities, including RAPCONs and RATCFs, are required to monitor all assigned frequencies continuously, USAF facilities may not monitor all unpublished discrete frequencies.\nPILOT ACKNOWLEDGMENT/READ BACK\nEnsure pilots acknowledge all Air Traffic Clearances and ATC Instructions. When a pilot reads back an Air Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction:\nEnsure that items read back are correct.\nEnsure the read back of hold short instructions, whether a part of taxi instructions or a LAHSO clearance.\nEnsure pilots use call signs and/or registration numbers in any read back acknowledging an Air Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction.\nNOTE-\nATC Clearance/Instruction Read Back guidance for pilots in the AIM states:\nAlthough pilots should read back the “numbers,” unless otherwise required by procedure or controller request, pilots may acknowledge clearances, control instructions, or other information by using “Wilco,” “Roger,” “Affirmative,” or other words or remarks with their aircraft identification.\nAltitudes contained in charted procedures, such as departure procedures, instrument approaches, etc., need not be read back unless they are specifically stated by the controller.\nInitial read back of a taxi, departure or landing clearance should include the runway assignment, including left, right, center, etc. if applicable.\nUntil a pilot acknowledges a controller's clearance or instruction, a controller cannot know if a pilot will comply with the clearance or remain as previously cleared.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Climbing to Flight Level three three zero, United Twelve” or “November Five Charlie Tango, roger, cleared to land runway four left.”\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - AIR TRAFFIC CLEARANCE.\nP/CG Term - ATC INSTRUCTIONS.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-4-4, Communications Failure.\nAIM, Para 4-2-3, Contact Procedures.\nAIM, Para 4-4-7, Pilot Responsibility upon Clearance Issuance.\nAIM, Para 6-4-1, Two-way Radio Communications Failure.\nFederal Register, April 1, 1999 14 CFR Part 91, Pilot Responsibility for Compliance with ATC Clearances and Instructions.\nAUTHORIZED INTERRUPTIONS\nAs necessary, authorize a pilot to interrupt his/her communications guard.\nNOTE-\nSome users have adopted procedures to ensure uninterrupted receiving capability with ATC when a pilot with only one operative communications radio must interrupt his/her communications guard because of a safety related problem requiring airborne communications with his/her company. In this event, pilots will request approval to abandon guard on the assigned ATC frequency for a mutually agreeable time period. Additionally, they will inform controllers of the NAVAID voice facility and the company frequency they will monitor.\nAUTHORIZED TRANSMISSIONS\nTransmit only those messages necessary for air traffic control or otherwise contributing to air safety.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-2-2, Authorized Messages Not Directly Associated with Air Traffic Services.\nFALSE OR DECEPTIVE COMMUNICATIONS\nTake action to detect, prevent, and report false, deceptive, or phantom controller communications to an aircraft or controller. The following must be accomplished when false or deceptive communications occur:\nCorrect false information.\nBroadcast an alert to aircraft operating on all frequencies within the area where deceptive or phantom transmissions have been received.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft. False ATC instructions have been received in the area of Long Beach Airport. Exercise extreme caution on all frequencies and verify instructions.”\nCollect pertinent information regarding the incident.\nNotify the operations supervisor of the false, deceptive, or phantom transmission and report all relevant information pertaining to the incident.\nAUTHORIZED RELAYS\nRelay operational information to aircraft or aircraft operators as necessary. Do not agree to handle such messages on a regular basis. Give the source of any such message you relay.\nRelay official FAA messages as required.\nNOTE-\nThe FAA Administrator and Deputy Administrator will sometimes use code phrases to identify themselves in air‐to‐ground communications as follows:\nAdministrator: “SAFEAIR ONE.”\nDeputy Administrator: “SAFEAIR TWO.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Miami Center, Jetstar One, this is SAFEAIR ONE, (message).”\nRelay operational information to military aircraft  operating on, or planning to operate on IRs.\nRADIO MESSAGE FORMAT\nUse the following format for radio communications  with an aircraft:\nSector/position on initial radio contact:\nIdentification of aircraft.\nIdentification of ATC unit.\nMessage (if any).\nThe word “over” if required.\nSubsequent radio transmissions from the same sector/position must use the same format, except the identification of the ATC unit may be omitted.\nTERMINAL. You may omit aircraft identification after initial contact when conducting the final portion of a radar approach.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nABBREVIATED TRANSMISSIONS\nTransmissions may be abbreviated as follows:\nUse the identification prefix and the last 3 digits or letters of the aircraft identification after communications have been established with a U.S. civil aircraft using the aircraft registration as identification.\nDo not abbreviate:\nSimilar sounding aircraft identifications.\nAircraft call signs, including:\nAircraft having an International Civil Aviation Organization three letter designator (ICAO 3LD) and other aircraft with an FAA authorized call sign (U.S. special or local).\nAircraft with a military call sign.\nForeign aircraft using the foreign civil registration number as identification.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-15, Emphasis for Clarity.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7610.12, Assignment and Authorization of Call Sign Designators and Associated Telephonies.\nOmit the facility identification after communication has been established.\nTransmit the message immediately after the callup (without waiting for the aircraft's reply) when the message is short and receipt is generally assured.\nOmit the word “over” if the message obviously requires a reply.\nINTERPHONE TRANSMISSION PRIORITIES\nGive priority to interphone transmissions as follows:\nFirst priority. Emergency messages including essential information on aircraft accidents or suspected accidents. After an actual emergency has passed, give a lower priority to messages relating to that accident.\nSecond priority. Clearances and control instructions.\nThird priority. Movement and control messages using the following order of preference when possible:\nProgress reports.\nDeparture or arrival reports.\nFlight plans.\nFourth priority. Movement messages on VFR aircraft.\nPRIORITY INTERRUPTION\nUse the words “emergency” or “control” for interrupting lower priority messages when you have an emergency or control message to transmit.\nINTERPHONE MESSAGE FORMAT\nUse the following format for interphone intra/interfacility communications:\nBoth the caller and receiver identify their facility and/or position in a manner that ensures they will not be confused with another position.\nNOTE-\nOther means of identifying a position, such as substituting departure or arrival gate/fix names for position identification, may be used. However, it must be operationally beneficial, and the procedure fully covered in a letter of agreement or a facility directive, as appropriate.\nEXAMPLE-\nCaller: “Albuquerque Center Sixty Three, Amarillo Departure.”\nReceiver: “Albuquerque Center.”\nBetween two facilities which utilize numeric position identification, the caller must identify both facility and position.\nEXAMPLE-\nCaller: “Albuquerque Sixty Three, Fort Worth Eighty Two.”\nCaller states the type of coordination to be accomplished when advantageous. For example, handoff or APREQ.\nThe caller states the message.\nThe receiver states the response to the caller's message followed by the receiver's operating initials.\nThe caller states his or her operating initials.\nEXAMPLE-\nCaller: “Denver High, R Twenty-five.”\nReceiver: “Denver High.”\nCaller: “Request direct Denver for Northwest Three Twenty-eight.”\nReceiver: “Northwest Three Twenty-eight direct Denver approved. H.F.”\nCaller: “G.M.”\nReceiver: “Denver High, Go ahead override.”\nCaller: “R Twenty-five, Request direct Denver for Northwest Three Twenty-eight.”\nReceiver: “Northwest Three Twenty-eight direct Denver approved. H.F.”\nCaller: “G.M.”\nCaller: (“Bolos” is a departure gate in Houston ARTCC's Sabine sector)-“Bolos, Houston local.”\nReceiver: “Bolos.”\nCaller: “Request Flight Level three five zero for American Twenty-five.”\nReceiver: “American Twenty-five Flight Level three five zero approved, A.C.”\nCaller: “G.M.”\nCaller: “Sector Twelve, Ontario Approach, APREQ.”\nReceiver: “Sector Twelve.”\nCaller: “Cactus Five forty-two heading one three zero and climbing to one four thousand.”\nReceiver: “Cactus Five forty-two heading one three zero and climbing to one four thousand approved. B.N.”\nCaller: “A.M.”\nCaller: “Zanesville, Columbus, seventy-three line, handoff.”\nReceiver: “Zanesville.”\nCaller: “Five miles east of Appleton VOR, United Three Sixty-six.”\nReceiver: “United Three Sixty-six, radar contact, A.Z.”\nCaller: “M.E.”\nIdentify the interphone voice line on which the call is being made when two or more such lines are collocated at the receiving operating position.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Washington Center, Washington Approach on the Fifty Seven line.”\n“Chicago Center, O'Hare Tower handoff on the Departure West line.”\nTERMINAL. The provisions of subparagraphs a, b, c, e, f, g, and paragraph 2-4-13, Interphone Message Termination, may be omitted provided:\nAbbreviated standard coordination procedures are contained in a facility directive describing the specific conditions and positions that may utilize an abbreviated interphone message format; and\nThere will be no possibility of misunderstanding which positions are using the abbreviated procedures.\nINTERPHONE MESSAGE TERMINATION\nTerminate interphone messages with your operating initials.\nWORDS AND PHRASES\nUse the words or phrases in radiotelephone and interphone communication as contained in the P/CG or, within areas where Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) is in use, the phraseology contained in the applicable CPDLC message set.\nThe word super must be used as part of the identification in all communications with or about super aircraft.\nThe word heavy must be used as part of the identification in all communications with or about heavy aircraft.\nEN ROUTE. The use of the words super or heavy may be omitted except as follows:\nIn communications with a terminal facility about super or heavy aircraft operations.\nIn communications with or about super or heavy aircraft with regard to an airport where the en route center is providing approach control service.\nIn communications with or about super or heavy aircraft when the separation from a following aircraft may become less than 5 miles by approved procedure.\nWhen issuing traffic advisories.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Fifty-Eight Heavy.”\nNOTE-\nMost airlines will use the word “super” or “heavy” following the company prefix and flight number when establishing communications or when changing frequencies within a terminal facility's area.\nWhen in radio communications with “Air Force One” or “Air Force Two,” do not add the heavy designator to the call sign. State only the call sign “Air Force One/Two” regardless of the type aircraft.\nEMPHASIS FOR CLARITY\nTreat aircraft with similar sounding aircraft identifications by emphasizing appropriate digits, letters, or similar sounding words to aid in distinguishing between similar sounding aircraft identifications. Do not abbreviate similar sounding aircraft identifications.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-9, Abbreviated Transmissions.\nTreat aircraft with similar sounding call signs by restating the call sign after the flight number.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Thirty-one United.”\n“American Thirty-one American.”\nNOTE-\nSimilar sounding call signs procedures may apply to ICAO 3LD U.S. special, local, or military call sign.\nNotify each pilot concerned when communicating with aircraft having similar sounding identifications.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Thirty-one United, Miami Center, U.S. Air Thirty-one is also on this frequency, acknowledge.”\n“U.S. Air Thirty-one U.S. Air, Miami Center, United Thirty-one is also on this frequency, acknowledge.”\nNotify the operations supervisor-in-charge of any duplicate call signs or phonetically similar-sounding call signs when the aircraft are operating simultaneously within the same sector.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-14, Aircraft Identification Problems.\nICAO PHONETICS\nUse the ICAO pronunciation of numbers and individual letters.

Weather InformationFAMILIARIZATION\nControllers must become familiar with pertinent weather information when coming on duty, and stay aware of current and forecasted weather information needed to perform ATC duties.\nNOTE-\nEvery phase of flight has the potential to be impacted by weather, and emphasis must be placed on gathering, reporting and disseminating weather information.\nPIREP SOLICITATION AND DISSEMINATION\nEmphasis must be placed on the solicitation and dissemination of Urgent (UUA) and Routine (UA) PIREPs. Timely dissemination of PIREPs alerts pilots to weather conditions and provides information useful to forecasters in the development of aviation forecasts. PIREPs also provide information required by ATC in the provision of safe and efficient use of airspace. This includes reports of strong frontal activity, squall lines, thunderstorms, light to severe icing, wind shear and turbulence (including clear air turbulence) of moderate or greater intensity, braking action, volcanic eruptions and volcanic ash clouds, detection of sulfur gases in the cabin, and other conditions pertinent to flight safety. Controllers must provide the information in sufficient detail to assist pilots in making decisions pertinent to flight safety.\nNOTE-\nRoutine PIREPs indicating a lack of forecasted weather conditions, for example, a lack of icing or turbulence, are also valuable to aviation weather forecasters and pilots. This is especially true when adverse conditions are expected or forecasted but do not develop or no longer exist.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-8, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-4, Braking Action.\nP/CG Term - BRAKING ACTION.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 6-3-1, Handling of SIGMETs, CWAs, and PIREPs.\nAIM, Para 7-5-9, Flight Operations in Volcanic Ash.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-1, Dissemination of Weather Information.FAA Order JO 7110.10, Chapter 8, Section 1, Pilot Weather Reports.\nSolicit PIREPs when requested, deemed necessary or any of the following conditions exists or is forecast for your area of jurisdiction:\nCeilings at or below 5,000 feet. These PIREPs must include cloud bases, tops and cloud coverage when available. Additionally, when providing approach control services, ensure that at least one descent/climb-out PIREP and other related phenomena is obtained each hour.\nVisibility (surface or aloft) at or less than 5 miles.\nThunderstorms and related phenomena.\nTurbulence of moderate degree or greater.\nIcing of light degree or greater.\nWind shear.\nBraking action reports less than good.\nVolcanic ash clouds.\nDetection of sulfur gases (SO2 or H2S), associated with volcanic activity, in the cabin.\nNOTE-\nThe smell of sulfur gases in the cockpit may indicate volcanic activity that has not yet been detected or reported and/or possible entry into an ash‐bearing cloud. SO2 is identifiable as the sharp, acrid odor of a freshly struck match. H2S has the odor of rotten eggs.\nPilots may forward PIREPs regarding volcanic activity using the format described in the Volcanic Activity Reporting Form (VAR) as depicted in the AIM, Appendix 2.\nCategorize PIREPs as follows:\nURGENT. The following weather phenomena must be classified as an URGENT PIREP (UUA):\nTornadoes, funnel clouds, or waterspouts.\nSevere or extreme turbulence (including clear air turbulence).\nSevere icing.\nHail.\nLow‐level wind shear (LLWS). For the safety of light aircraft, classify low‐level wind shear PIREPs as UUA if the pilot reports airspeed fluctuations of 10 knots or more. Classify reports of low‐level wind shear with airspeed fluctuations less than 10 knots as routine. If airspeed fluctuation is not reported, classify PIREP as UUA.\nNOTE-\nLow‐level wind shear is defined as wind shear within 2,000 feet of the surface.\nVolcanic eruption, ash clouds, and/or detection of sulfur gases (H2S or SO2) in the cabin, however, if a pilot only reported the smell of H2S or SO2 in the cabin and confirmed no volcanic ash clouds were present, classify the report as a ROUTINE PIREP.\nAny other weather phenomena reported which in your opinion may be hazardous, or potentially hazardous, to flight operations.\nROUTINE.

In areas of significant weather, plan ahead and be prepared to suggest, upon pilot request, the use of alternative routes/altitudes.\nAn approval for lateral deviation authorizes the pilot to maneuver left or right within the lateral limits specified in the clearance.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 7-1-12, ATC Inflight Weather Avoidance Assistance, Subpara b1(b).\nWhen approving a weather deviation for an aircraft that had previously been issued a crossing altitude, including climb via or descend via clearances, issue an altitude to maintain and, if necessary, assign a speed along with the clearance to deviate. If you intend on clearing the aircraft to resume the procedure, advise the pilot.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDEVIATION (restrictions, if necessary) APPROVED, MAINTAIN (altitude), (if necessary) MAINTAIN (speed), (if applicable) EXPECT TO RESUME (SID/STAR, etc.) AT (NAVAID, fix/waypoint).\nNOTE-\nAfter a climb via or descend via clearance has been issued, a vector/deviation off of a SID/STAR cancels all published altitude and speed restrictions on the procedure. The aircraft's Flight Management System (FMS) may be unable to process crossing altitude restrictions once the aircraft leaves the SID/STAR lateral path. Without an assigned altitude, the aircraft's FMS may revert to leveling off at the altitude set by the pilot, which may be the SID/STAR published top or bottom altitude.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-2, Methods.\nIf a pilot enters your area of jurisdiction already deviating for weather, advise the pilot of any additional weather which may affect the route.\nNOTE-\nWhen aircraft are deviating around weather and transitioning from sector to sector, unless previously coordinated, the receiving controller should not assume that the transferring controller has issued weather affecting the aircraft's route of flight.\nIf traffic and airspace (i.e., special use airspace boundaries, LOA constraints) permit, combine the approval for weather deviation with a clearance on course.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDEVIATION (restrictions if necessary) APPROVED, WHEN ABLE, PROCEED DIRECT (name of NAVAID/WAYPOINT/FIX)\nor\nDEVIATION (restrictions if necessary) APPROVED, WHEN ABLE, FLY HEADING (degrees), VECTOR TO JOIN (airway) AND ADVISE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Deviation 20 degrees right approved, when able proceed direct O'Neill VORTAC and advise.” En Route: The corresponding fourth line entry is “D20R/ONL” or “D20R/F.”\n“Deviation 30 degrees left approved, when able fly heading zero niner zero, vector to join J324 and advise.” En Route: In this case the free text character limitation prevents use of fourth line coordination and verbal coordination is required.\nIf traffic or airspace prevents you from clearing the aircraft on course at the time of the approval for a weather deviation, instruct the pilot to advise when clear of weather.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDEVIATION (restrictions if necessary) APPROVED, ADVISE CLEAR OF WEATHER.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Deviation North of course approved, advise clear of weather.”\nEn Route: In this case the corresponding fourth line entry is “DN,” and the receiving controller must provide a clearance to rejoin the route in accordance with paragraph 2-1-15c.\nWhen a deviation cannot be approved as requested because of traffic, take an alternate course of action that provides positive control for traffic resolution and satisfies the pilot's need to avoid weather.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNABLE REQUESTED DEVIATION, FLY HEADING (heading), ADVISE CLEAR OF WEATHER\nor\nUNABLE REQUESTED DEVIATION, TURN (number of degrees) DEGREES  (left or right) VECTOR FOR TRAFFIC, ADVISE CLEAR OF WEATHER,\nEXAMPLE-\n“Unable requested deviation, turn thirty degrees right vector for traffic, advise clear of weather.”\nWhen forwarding weather deviation information, the transferring controller must clearly coordinate the nature of the route guidance service being provided. This coordination should include, but is not limited to: assigned headings, suggested headings, pilot-initiated deviations. Coordination can be accomplished by: verbal, automated, or predetermined procedures. Emphasis should be made between: controller assigned headings, suggested headings, or pilot initiated deviations.\nEXAMPLE-\n“(call sign) assigned heading three three zero for weather avoidance”\n“(call sign) deviating west, pilot requested…”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use Of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-6, Receiving Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-9, Prearranged Coordination.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-10, En Route Fourth Line Data Block Usage.\nEn Route Fourth Line Data Transfer\nThe inclusion of /(NAVAID) or /(waypoint), when preceded by the designated characters for weather deviations, indicates that a pilot has been authorized to deviate for weather and rejoin the route at the specified NAVAID or waypoint. The use of /F, following the designated weather deviation characters, indicates that a pilot has been authorized to deviate and rejoin the route of flight at the next NAVAID or waypoint in the flight plan.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-10, En Route Fourth Line Data Block Usage.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Deviation twenty degrees right approved, when able proceed direct O'Neill VORTAC and advise.” In this case, the corresponding fourth line entry is “D20R/ONL,” or “D20R/F” if O'Neill is the next NAVAID in the flight plan.\nThe absence of a NAVAID, waypoint, or /F in the fourth line indicates that:\nThe pilot has been authorized to deviate for weather only, and the receiving controller must provide a clearance to rejoin the route in accordance with paragraph 2-1-15c.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Deviation twenty degrees right approved, advise clear of weather.”\nThe free text character limitation prevents the use of fourth line coordination. Verbal coordination is required.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Deviation 30 degrees left approved, when able fly heading zero niner zero, vector to join J324 and advise.”\nThe supervisory traffic management coordinator-in-charge/operations supervisor/ controller‐in‐charge must verify the digitized radar weather information by the best means available (e.g., pilot reports, local tower personnel, etc.) if the weather data displayed by digitized radar is reported as questionable or erroneous. Errors in weather radar presentation must be reported to the technical operations technician and the air traffic supervisor must determine if the digitized radar derived weather data is to be displayed and a NOTAM distributed.\nNOTE-\nAnomalous propagation (AP) is a natural occurrence affecting radar and does not in itself constitute a weather circuit failure.\nDISSEMINATING OFFICIAL WEATHER INFORMATION\nTERMINAL. Observed elements of weather information must be disseminated as follows:\nGeneral weather information, such as “large breaks in the overcast,” “visibility lowering to the south,” or similar statements which do not include specific values, and any elements derived directly from instruments, pilots, or radar may be transmitted to pilots or other ATC facilities without consulting the weather reporting station.\nSpecific values, such as ceiling and visibility, may be transmitted if obtained by one of the following means:\nYou are properly certificated and acting as official weather observer for the elements being reported.\nNOTE-\nUSAF controllers do not serve as official weather observers.\nYou have obtained the information from the official observer for the elements being reported.\nThe weather report was composed or verified by the weather station.\nThe information is obtained from a FAA approved automation surface weather system.\nDifferences between weather elements observed from the tower and those reported by the weather station must be reported to the official observer for the element concerned.\nHAZARDOUS INFLIGHT WEATHER ADVISORY\nControllers must advise pilots of hazardous weather that may impact operations within 150 NM of their sector or area of jurisdiction. Hazardous weather information contained in the advisories includes Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) (except over the CONUS), Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET), Convective SIGMET (WST), Urgent Pilot Weather Reports (UUA), and Center Weather Advisories (CWA). Facilities must review alert messages to determine the geographical area and operational impact of hazardous weather information. Advisories are not required if aircraft on your frequency(s) will not be affected.\nNOTE-\nIn recognition that there are several uses/definitions for the acronym CONUS, references herein to CONUS are specific to the contiguous United States (i.e., “lower 48”).\nControllers must broadcast a hazardous inflight weather advisory on all frequencies, except emergency frequency, upon receipt of hazardous weather information. Controllers are required to disseminate data based on the operational impact on the sector or area of control jurisdiction. Pilots requesting additional information must be directed to contact the nearest Flight Service.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT.

However, issuance of the setting of an adjacent station during periods that a steep gradient exists will serve to inform the pilot of the difference between the setting he/she is using and the pressure in the local area and better enable him/her to choose a more advantageous setting within the limitations of 14 CFR section 91.121.\nTERMINAL. To all departures. Unless specifically requested by the pilot, the altimeter setting need not be issued to local aircraft operators who have requested this omission in writing or to scheduled air carriers.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-1, Departure Information.\nTERMINAL. To arriving aircraft on initial contact or as soon as possible thereafter.

For the destination airport to arriving aircraft, approximately 50 miles from the destination, if an approach control facility does not serve the airport.\nIn addition to the altimeter setting provided on initial contact, issue changes in altimeter setting to aircraft executing a nonprecision instrument approach as frequently as practical when the official weather report includes the remarks “pressure falling rapidly.”\nIf the altimeter setting must be obtained by the pilot of an arriving aircraft from another source, instruct the pilot to obtain the altimeter setting from that source.\nNOTE-\nThe destination altimeter setting, whether from a local or remote source, is the setting upon which the instrument approach is predicated.\nApproach charts for many locations specify the source of altimeter settings as non‐FAA facilities, such as UNICOMs.\nWhen issuing clearance to descend below the lowest usable flight level, advise the pilot of the altimeter setting of the weather reporting station nearest the point the aircraft will descend below that flight level. Local directives may delegate this responsibility to an alternate sector when Optimized Profile Descents (OPD) commence in sectors consisting entirely of Class A airspace.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) aircraft that are authorized to operate in restricted areas, MOAs, and ATC assigned airspace areas on “single altimeter settings” (CFR Exemption 2861A), must be issued altimeter settings in accordance with standard procedures while the aircraft are en route to and from the restricted areas, MOAs, and ATC assigned airspace areas.\nNOTE-\nThe DoD is responsible for conducting all “single altimeter setting” operations within the boundaries of MOAs, restricted areas, and ATCAAs. Under an LOA, the DoD provides safe altitude clearance between DoD aircraft and other aircraft operating within, above, and below the MOAs, restricted areas, and ATCAAs with appropriate clearance of terrain.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Appendix 4, Document 4, Grant of Exemption No. 2861A - Single Altimeter Setting For Frequent Transit of FL180.\nALTIMETER SETTINGS GREATER THAN 31.00 INCHES MERCURY\nWhen the barometric pressure is greater than 31.00 inches mercury (31” Hg), issue the altimeter setting and phraseology that high barometric pressure procedures are in effect:\nEn Route/Arrivals.

The altimeter setting does not directly affect the transponder reported altitude. ATC automation applies the current altimeter setting to the pressure altitude received and displays the altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level (MSL).\nWith a barometric pressure of 31.30” Hg and the aircraft's altimeter set at 31.00” Hg, the Mode C transponder will transmit the actual altitude of 3,300, feet while the altimeter only shows 3,000 feet. This will occur unless local directives authorize entering the altimeter setting 31.00” Hg into the ATC automation regardless of the actual barometric pressure.\nAirports unable to accurately measure barometric pressures above 31.00” Hg. will report the barometric pressure as “missing” or “in excess of 31.00” Hg.” Flight operations to or from those airports are restricted to VFR weather conditions.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Automatic Terminal Information Service ProceduresAPPLICATION\nUse the ATIS, where available, to provide advance noncontrol airport/terminal area and meteorological information to aircraft.\nIdentify each ATIS message by a phonetic letter code word at both the beginning and the end of the message. Automated systems will have the phonetic letter code automatically appended. Exceptions may be made where omissions are required because of special programs or equipment.\nEach alphabet letter phonetic word must be used sequentially, except as authorized in subparagraph a2, beginning with “Alpha,” ending with “Zulu,” and repeated without regard to the beginning of a new day. Identify the first resumed broadcast message with “Alpha” or the first assigned alphabet letter word in the event of a broadcast interruption of more than 12 hours.\nSpecific sequential portions of the alphabet may be assigned between facilities or an arrival and departure ATIS when designated by a letter of agreement or facility directive.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-4-1, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).\nThe ATIS recording must be reviewed for completeness, accuracy, speech rate, and proper enunciation before being transmitted.\nArrival and departure messages, when broadcast separately, need only contain information appropriate for that operation.\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nMaintain an ATIS message that reflects the most current arrival and departure information.\nMake a new recording when any of the following occur:\nUpon receipt of any new official weather regardless of whether there is or is not a change in values.\nWhen runway braking action reports are received that indicate runway braking is worse than that which is included in the current ATIS broadcast.\nWhen there is a change in any other pertinent data, such as runway change, instrument approach in use, new or canceled NOTAMs/PIREPs update, etc.\nWhen a pilot acknowledges that he/she has received the ATIS broadcast, controllers may omit those items contained in the broadcasts if they are current. Rapidly changing conditions will be issued by ATC, and the ATIS will contain the following:\nEXAMPLE-\n“Latest ceiling/visibility/altimeter/wind/(other conditions) will be issued by approach control/tower.”\nControllers must ensure that pilots receive the most current pertinent information by taking the following actions, as applicable:\nWhen a pilot does not state the appropriate ATIS code on initial contact, ask the pilot to confirm receipt of the current ATIS information.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Verify you have information CHARLIE.”\n“Information CHARLIE current. Advise when you have CHARLIE.”\nWhen a pilot is unable to receive the ATIS, issue the current weather, runway in use, approach/departure information, pertinent NOTAMs, and airport conditions.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Wind two five zero at one zero. Visibility one zero. Ceiling four thousand five hundred broken. Temperature three four. Dew point two eight. Altimeter three zero one zero. ILS-DME Runway Two Seven Approach in use. Departing Runway Two Two Right. Hazardous Weather Information for (geographical area) available on Flight Service Frequencies. Braking Action advisories are in effect.”\nAdvise aircraft of changes to the ATIS code by broadcasting the change on all appropriate frequencies. The broadcast must include changes to pertinent operational information, when known, that necessitated the ATIS change.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft, information ALPHA current.”\n“Attention all aircraft, information BRAVO current. MICROBURST advisories in effect.”\n“Attention all aircraft, information CHARLIE current. Numerous flocks of ducks in the immediate vicinity of (name) airport, altitude unknown.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nNOTE-\nNo additional acknowledgement is required when a controller broadcasts information subsequent to the pilot's initial acknowledgement of the ATIS. Requiring each aircraft to acknowledge receipt of pertinent changes (broadcast) after initial confirmation of the ATIS could significantly impact workload.\nPertinent conditions are those that have a clear decisive relevance to the safety of air traffic. As noted in paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority, there are many variables involved that make it virtually impossible to develop a standard list of changes that are classified as relevant to every conceivable situation. Each set of circumstances must be evaluated on its own merit, and when more than one action is required, controllers must exercise their best judgment based on the facts and circumstances known to them.\nCONTENT\nInclude the following in ATIS broadcast as appropriate:\nAirport/facility name.\nPhonetic letter code.\nTime of the latest weather sequence (UTC).\nWeather information consisting of:\nWind direction and velocity.\nVisibility.\nObstructions to vision.\nPresent weather consisting of: sky condition, temperature, dew point, altimeter, a density altitude advisory when appropriate, and other pertinent remarks included in the official weather observation. Always include weather observation remarks of lightning, cumulonimbus, and towering cumulus clouds.\nNOTE-\nASOS/AWOS is to be considered the primary source of wind direction, velocity, and altimeter data for weather observation purposes at those locations that are so equipped. The ASOS Operator Interface Device (OID) displays the magnetic wind as “MAG WND” in the auxiliary data location in the lower left-hand portion of the screen. Other OID displayed winds are true and are not to be used for operational purposes.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7900.5, Surface Weather Observing Table 3-2.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-2-1, Position Duties and Responsibilities.\nInstrument approach and runway in use.\nMan-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) alert and advisory. Specify the nature and location of threat or incident, whether reported or observed and by whom, time (if known), and notification to pilots to advise ATC if they need to divert.\nEXAMPLE-\n“MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS threat reported by TSA, Chicago area.” “Advise on initial contact if you want to divert.”\n“MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS attack observed by tower one-half mile northwest of airfield at one-two-five-zero Zulu.” “Advise on initial contact if you want to divert.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-13, MANPADS Alert.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-10, Handling MANPADS Incidents.\nTerminal facilities must include reported unauthorized laser illumination events on the ATIS broadcast for one hour following the last report. Include the time, location, altitude, color, and direction of the laser as reported by the pilot.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION EVENT, (UTC time), (location), (altitude), (color), (direction).\nEXAMPLE-\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION EVENT, AT 0100z, 8 MILE FINAL RUNWAY 18R AT 3,000 FEET, GREEN LASER FROM THE SOUTHWEST.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-14, Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-30, Reporting Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\nThe ceiling/sky condition, visibility, and obstructions to vision may be omitted if the ceiling is above 5,000 feet and the visibility is more than 5 miles.\nEXAMPLE-\nA remark may be made, “The weather is better than five thousand and five.”\nInstrument/visual approach/es in use. Specify landing runway/s unless the runway is that to which the instrument approach is made. Before advertising non-precision approaches, priority should be given to available precision, then APV approaches.\nDeparture runway/s (to be given only if different from landing runway/s or in the instance of a “departure only” ATIS).\nTaxiway closures which affect the entrance or exit of active runways, other closures which impact airport operations, other NOTAMs and PIREPs pertinent to operations in the terminal area. Inform pilots of where hazardous weather is occurring and how the information may be obtained. Include available information of known bird activity.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, 2-1-23, Bird Activity Information.\nWhen a runway length has been temporarily or permanently shortened, ensure that the word “WARNING” prefaces the runway number, and that the word “shortened” is also included in the text of the message.\nAvailable runway length, as stated in the NOTAM, must be included in the ATIS broadcast.  This information must be broadcast for the duration of the construction project.\nFor permanently shortened runways, facilities must continue to broadcast this information for a minimum of 30 days or until the Chart Supplement has been updated, whichever is longer.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nWARNING, RUNWAY (number) HAS BEEN SHORTENED, (length in feet) FEET AVAILABLE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Warning, Runway One-Zero has been shortened, niner-thousand eight hundred and fifty feet available.”\nRunway Condition Codes (RwyCC) when provided. Include the time of the report.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) condition codes (first value, second value, third value) AT (time),\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two Seven, condition codes two, two, one at one zero one eight Zulu.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-1, Landing Area Condition.\nRunway Condition Codes “3/3/3” and the statement “Slippery When Wet.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway (number) condition codes three, three, three, Slippery When Wet at one two five five Zulu.”\nNOTE-\nA Slippery When Wet FICON NOTAM indicates a runway has failed a friction survey, for example, due to excessive rubber build-up. Airport Operators will notify ATCT operational personnel of this concern and issue a FICON NOTAM prior to the expected arrival of rain. The FICON NOTAM will be canceled when the rain has ended and the runway environment is determined to be dry by the Airport Operator.\nRunway Condition codes “X/X/X.” When a FICON NOTAM indicates these values, the statement “Runway Condition Codes Missing” must be included on the ATIS broadcast.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway (number) condition codes missing at one three four seven Zulu.”\nNOTE-\nA FICON NOTAM may be generated with “X/X/X” instead of Runway Condition Codes. This will occur when the NOTAM user interface is not functioning correctly; however, a FICON NOTAM is still present.\nOther optional information as local conditions dictate in coordination with ATC. This may include such items as VFR arrival frequencies, temporary airport conditions, LAHSO operations being con-ducted, or other perishable items that may appear only for a matter of hours or a few days on the ATIS message.\nWhen all 3 runway segments (touchdown, midpoint, and rollout) are reporting a code of 6, the Airport Operator will notify ATC that runway condition codes are no longer reportable.\nLow level wind shear/microburst when reported by pilots or is detected on a wind shear detection system.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-8, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories.\nA statement which advises the pilot to read back instructions to hold short of a runway. The air traffic manager may elect to remove this requirement 60 days after implementation provided that removing the statement from the ATIS does not result in increased requests from aircraft for read back of hold short instructions.\nInstructions for the pilot to acknowledge receipt of the ATIS message by informing the controller on initial contact.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Boston Tower Information Delta. One four zero zero Zulu. Wind two five zero at one zero. Visibility one zero. Ceiling four thousand five hundred broken. Temperature three four. Dew point two eight. Altimeter three zero one zero. ILS-DME Runway Two Seven Approach in use. Departing Runway Two Two Right. Hazardous Weather Information for (geographical area) available on Flight Service Frequencies. Advise on initial contact you have Delta.”\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

GeneralPROVIDE SERVICE\nProvide airport traffic control service based only upon observed or known traffic and airport conditions.\nNOTE-\nWhen operating in accordance with CFRs, it is the responsibility of the pilot to avoid collision with other aircraft. However, due to the limited space around terminal locations, traffic information can aid pilots in avoiding collision between aircraft operating within Class B, Class C, or Class D surface areas and the terminal radar service areas, and transiting aircraft operating in proximity to terminal locations.\nPREVENTIVE CONTROL\nProvide preventive control service only to aircraft operating in accordance with a letter of agreement. When providing this service, issue advice or instructions only if a situation develops which requires corrective action.\nNOTE-\nPreventive control differs from other airport traffic control in that repetitious, routine approval of pilot action is eliminated. Controllers intervene only when they observe a traffic conflict developing.\nAirfield Operating instructions, Memorandums of Understanding, or other specific directives used exclusively by the Department of Defense (DoD) satisfies the criteria in paragraph 3-1-2 above.\nUSE OF ACTIVE RUNWAYS\nThe local controller has primary responsibility for operations conducted on the active runway and must control the use of those runways. Positive coordination and control is required as follows:\nNOTE-\nExceptions may be authorized only as provided in paragraph 1-1-11, Waivers to This Order, and FAA Order JO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, paragraph 10-1-7, Use of Active Runways, where justified by extraordinary circumstances at specific locations.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-1-11, Waivers to This Order.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-1-7, Use of Active Runways.\nGround control must obtain approval from local control before authorizing an aircraft or a vehicle to cross or use any portion of an active runway. The coordination must include the point/intersection at the runway where the operation will occur.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCROSS (runway) AT (point/intersection).\nWhen the local controller authorizes another controller to cross an active runway, the local controller must verbally specify the runway to be crossed and the point/intersection at the runway where the operation will occur preceded by the word “cross.”\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCROSS (runway) AT (point/intersection).\nThe ground controller must advise the local controller when the coordinated runway operation is complete. This may be accomplished verbally or through visual aids as specified by a facility directive.\nUSA/USAF/USN NOT APPLICABLE.  Authorization for aircraft/vehicles to taxi/proceed on or along an active runway, for purposes other than crossing, must be provided via direct communications on the appropriate local control frequency. This authorization may be provided on the ground control frequency after coordination with local control is completed for those operations specifically described in a facility directive.\nNOTE-\nThe USA, USAF, and USN establish local operating procedures in accordance with, respectively, USA, USAF, and USN directives.\nThe local controller must coordinate with the ground controller before using a runway not previously designated as active.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-4, Coordination Between Local and Ground Controllers.\nCOORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL AND GROUND CONTROLLERS\nLocal and ground controllers must exchange information as necessary for the safe and efficient use of airport runways and movement areas. This may be accomplished via verbal means, flight progress strips, other written information, or automation displays. As a minimum, provide aircraft identification and applicable runway/intersection/taxiway information as follows:\nGround control must notify local control when a departing aircraft has been taxied to a runway other than one previously designated as active.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-3, Use of Active Runways.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-1-6, Selecting Active Runways.\nGround control must notify local control of any aircraft taxied to an intersection for takeoff. This notification may be accomplished by verbal means or by flight progress strips.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-7, Wake Turbulence Separation for Intersection Departures.\nWhen the runways in use for landing/departing aircraft are not visible from the tower or the aircraft using them are not visible on radar, advise the local/ground controller of the aircraft's location before releasing the aircraft to the other controller.\nVEHICLES/EQUIPMENT/PERSONNEL NEAR/ON RUNWAYS\nWhen established in a letter of agreement (LOA), vehicles, equipment, and personnel in two-way communications with ATC may be authorized to operate in the runway safety area (RSA) up to the edge of the runway surface, which includes when aircraft are arriving, departing, or taxiing along the runway.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nPROCEED AS REQUESTED; (and if necessary, additional instructions or information).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-1, Letters of Agreement.\nNOTE-\nDoD-only airfields—See Service Manual and/or local operating procedures for guidance on aerodrome operations and LOA requirements.\nEnsure that the runway to be used is free of all known ground vehicles, equipment, and personnel before a departing aircraft starts takeoff or a landing aircraft crosses the runway threshold.\nNOTE-\n“PROCEED AS REQUESTED\" is not approved phraseology for instructing aircraft, vehicles, equipment, or personnel to cross or operate on a runway.\nNOTE-\nEstablishing hold lines/signs is the responsibility of the airport manager. Standards for surface measurements, markings, and signs are contained in the following Advisory Circulars; AC 150/5300-13, Airport Design; AC 150/5340-1, Standards for Airport Markings, and AC 150/5340-18, Standards for Airport Sign Systems. The operator is responsible to properly position the aircraft, vehicle, or equipment at the appropriate hold line/sign or designated point. The requirements in paragraph 3-1-12, Visually Scanning Runways, remain valid as appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-4, Runway Proximity.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-8-2, Touch‐and‐Go or Stop‐and‐Go or Low Approach.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nAC 150/5300-13, Airport Design.\nAC 150/5340-1, Standards for Airport Markings.\n14 CFR Section 91.129, Operations in Class D Airspace.\nAIM, Para 2-2-3, Obstruction Lights.\nP/CG Term - RUNWAY IN USE/ACTIVE RUNWAY/DUTY RUNWAY.\nTRAFFIC INFORMATION\nDescribe vehicles, equipment, or personnel on or near the movement area in a manner which will assist pilots in recognizing them.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Mower left of runway two seven.”\n“Trucks crossing approach end of runway two five.”\n“Workman on taxiway Bravo.”\n“Aircraft left of runway one eight.”\nDescribe the relative position of traffic in an easy to understand manner, such as “to your right” or “ahead of you.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Traffic, U.S. Air MD-Eighty on downwind leg to your left.”\n“King Air inbound from outer marker on straight‐in approach to runway one seven.”\n“Traffic, Boeing 737 on 2‐mile final to the parallel runway, runway two six right, cleared to land. Caution wake turbulence.\"\nWhen using a CTRD, you may issue traffic advisories using the standard radar phraseology prescribed in paragraph 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nPOSITION DETERMINATION\nDetermine the position of an aircraft, personnel or equipment before issuing taxi instructions, takeoff clearance, or authorizing personnel, and/or equipment to proceed onto the movement area.\nNOTE-\nWhen possible, positions of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and/or personnel may be determined visually or through use of a display system.  When ATC is unable to determine position visually or via a display system, position reports may be used.\nLOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ADVISORIES\nWhen low level wind shear/microburst is reported by pilots, Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS), or detected on wind shear detection systems such as LLWAS NE++, LLWAS-RS, WSP, or TDWR, controllers must issue the alert to all arriving and departing aircraft. Continue the alert to aircraft until it is broadcast on the ATIS and pilots indicate they have received the appropriate ATIS code. A statement must be included on the ATIS for 20 minutes following the last report or indication of the wind shear/microburst.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nLOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR (or MICROBURST, as appropriate) ADVISORIES IN EFFECT.\nNOTE-\nSome aircraft are equipped with Predictive Wind Shear (PWS) alert systems that warn the flight crew of a potential wind shear up to 3 miles ahead and 25 degrees either side of the aircraft heading at or below 1200' AGL. Pilot reports may include warnings received from PWS systems.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-2, PIREP Solicitation and Dissemination.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-1, Landing Information.\nAt facilities without ATIS, ensure that wind shear/microburst information is broadcast to all arriving and departing aircraft for 20 minutes following the last report or indication of wind shear/microburst.\nApply the following procedures and phraseology for the depicted wind shear detection system described below.\nAt locations equipped with LLWAS, the local controller must provide wind information as follows:\nNOTE-\nThe LLWAS is designed to detect low level wind shear conditions around the periphery of an airport. It does not detect wind shear beyond that limitation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-3, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Detection Systems.\nIf an alert is received, issue the airport wind and the displayed field boundary wind.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nWIND SHEAR ALERT. AIRPORT WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (Location of sensor) BOUNDARY WIND (direction) AT (velocity).\nIf multiple alerts are received, issue an advisory that there are wind shear alerts in two/several/all quadrants. After issuing the advisory, issue the airport wind in accordance with paragraph 3-9-1, Departure Information, followed by the field boundary wind most appropriate to the aircraft operation.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nWIND SHEAR ALERTS TWO/SEVERAL/ALL QUADRANTS. AIRPORT WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (Location of sensor) BOUNDARY WIND (direction) AT (velocity).\nIf requested by the pilot, issue specific field boundary wind information even though the LLWAS may not be in alert status.\nNOTE-\nThe requirements for issuance of wind information remain valid as appropriate under this paragraph, paragraph 3-9-1, Departure Information, and paragraph 3-10-1, Landing Information.\nWind shear detection systems, including TDWR, WSP, LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS-RS provide the capability of displaying microburst alerts, wind shear alerts, and wind information oriented to the threshold or departure end of a runway. When detected, the associated ribbon display allows the controller to read the displayed alert without any need for interpretation.\nIf a wind shear or microburst alert is received for the runway in use, issue the alert information for that runway to arriving and departing aircraft as it is displayed on the ribbon display.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Runway) (arrival/departure) WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ALERT, (windspeed) KNOT GAIN/LOSS, (location).\nEXAMPLE-\n17A MBA 40K - 3MF\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY 17 ARRIVAL MICROBURST ALERT 40 KNOT LOSS 3 MILE FINAL.\nEXAMPLE-\n17D WSA 25K+ 2MD\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY 17 DEPARTURE WIND SHEAR ALERT 25 KNOT GAIN 2 MILE DEPARTURE.\nIf requested by the pilot or deemed appropriate by the controller, issue the displayed wind information oriented to the threshold or departure end of the runway.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Runway) DEPARTURE/THRESHOLD WIND (direction) AT (velocity).\nLLWAS NE++ or LLWAS-RS may detect a possible wind shear/microburst at the edge of the system but may be unable to distinguish between a wind shear and a microburst. A wind shear alert message will be displayed, followed by an asterisk, advising of a possible wind shear outside of the system network.\nNOTE-\nLLWAS NE++ when associated with TDWR can detect wind shear/microbursts outside the network if the TDWR fails.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Appropriate wind or alert information) POSSIBLE WIND SHEAR OUTSIDE THE NETWORK.\nIf unstable conditions produce multiple alerts, issue an advisory of multiple wind shear/microburst alerts followed by specific alert or wind information most appropriate to the aircraft operation.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nMULTIPLE WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ALERTS (specific alert or wind information).\nThe LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS-RS are designed to operate with as many as 50 percent of the total sensors inoperative. When all three remote sensors designated for a specific runway arrival or departure wind display line are inoperative then the LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS-RS for that runway arrival/departure must be considered out of service. When a specific runway arrival or departure wind display line is inoperative and wind shear/microburst activity is likely; (for example, frontal activity, convective storms, PIREPs), the following statement must be included on the ATIS, “WIND SHEAR AND MICROBURST INFORMATION FOR RUNWAY (runway number) ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE NOT AVAILABLE.”\nNOTE-\nThe geographic situation display (GSD) is a supervisory planning tool and is not intended to be a primary tool for microburst or wind shear.\nWind Shear Escape Procedures.\nIf an aircraft under your control informs you that it is performing a wind shear escape, do not issue control instructions that are contrary to pilot actions.  ATC should continue to provide safety alerts regarding terrain or obstacles and traffic advisories for the escape aircraft, as appropriate.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Denver Tower, United 1154, wind shear escape.”\nNOTE-\nAircraft that execute a wind shear escape maneuver will usually conduct a full power climb straight ahead and will not accept any control instructions until onboard systems advise the crew or the pilot in command (PIC) advises ATC that the escape maneuver is no longer required.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - WIND SHEAR ESCAPE.\nUnless advised by additional aircraft that they are also performing an escape procedure, do not presume that other aircraft in the proximity of the escape aircraft are responding to wind shear alerts/events as well. Continue to provide control instructions, safety alerts, and traffic advisories, as appropriate.\nOnce the responding aircraft has initiated a wind shear escape maneuver, the controller is not responsible for providing approved separation between the aircraft that is responding to an escape and any other aircraft, airspace, terrain, or obstacle. Responsibility for approved separation resumes when one of the following conditions is met:\nDepartures:\nA crew member informs ATC that the wind shear escape maneuver is complete and ATC observes that approved separation has been re-established, or\nA crew member informs ATC that the escape maneuver is complete and has resumed a previously assigned departure clearance/routing.\nArrivals:\nA crew member informs ATC that the escape maneuver is complete, and\nThe aircrew has executed an alternate clearance or requested further instructions.\nNOTE-\nWhen the escape procedure is complete, the flight crew must advise ATC they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or request further instructions.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Denver Tower, United 1154, wind shear escape complete, resuming last assigned heading/(name) DP/clearance.”\nOr\n“Denver Tower, United 1154, wind shear escape complete, request further instructions.”\nUSE OF TOWER RADAR DISPLAYS\nUncertified tower display workstations must be used only as an aid to assist controllers in visually locating aircraft or in determining their spatial relationship to known geographical points. Radar services and traffic advisories are not to be provided using uncertified tower display workstations. General information may be given in an easy to understand manner, such as “to your right” or “ahead of you.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Follow the aircraft ahead of you passing the river at the stacks.” “King Air passing left to right.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-5-3, Functional Use of Certified Tower Radar Displays.\nLocal controllers may use certified tower radar displays for the following purposes:\nTo determine an aircraft's identification, exact location, or spatial relationship to other aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThis authorization does not alter visual separation procedures. When employing visual separation, the provisions of paragraph 7-2-1, Visual Separation, apply unless otherwise authorized by the Service Area Director of Air Traffic Operations.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-2, Primary Radar Identification Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-4, Terminal Automation Systems Identification Methods.\nTo provide aircraft with radar traffic advisories.\nTo provide a direction or suggested headings to VFR aircraft as a method for radar identification or as an advisory aid to navigation.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification), PROCEED (direction)-BOUND, (other instructions or information as necessary),\nor\n(identification), SUGGESTED HEADING (degrees), (other instructions as necessary).\nNOTE-\nIt is important that the pilot be aware of the fact that the directions or headings being provided are suggestions or are advisory in nature. This is to keep the pilot from being inadvertently misled into assuming that radar vectors (and other associated radar services) are being provided when, in fact, they are not.\nTo provide information and instructions to aircraft operating within the surface area for which the tower has responsibility.\nEXAMPLE-\n“TURN BASE LEG NOW.”\nNOTE-\nUnless otherwise authorized, tower radar displays are intended to be an aid to local controllers in meeting their responsibilities to the aircraft operating on the runways or within the surface area. They are not intended to provide radar benefits to pilots except for those accrued through a more efficient and effective local control position. In addition, local controllers at nonapproach control towers must devote the majority of their time to visually scanning the runways and local area; an assurance of continued positive radar identification could place distracting and operationally inefficient requirements upon the local controller. Therefore, since the requirements of paragraph 5-3-1, Application, cannot be assured, the radar functions prescribed above are not considered to be radar services and pilots should not be advised of being in “radar contact.”\nAdditional functions may be performed provided the procedures have been reviewed and authorized by appropriate management levels.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-4, Minima.\nIf there is an outage of the ASR supporting the ASDE system and Multilateration (MLAT) is inoperative or is not present at airports with an ASDE system, the tower position(s) responsible for aircraft on approach to the airport must enable the ADS-B indicator on the tower display workstation(s) (TDW(s)).\nNOTE-\nThe ADS-B indicator will only display if the TDW is operating in Fused Display Mode.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-6-2, Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-14-5, Information Displayed.\nOBSERVED ABNORMALITIES\nWhen requested by a pilot or when you deem it necessary, inform an aircraft of any observed abnormal aircraft condition.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Item) APPEAR/S (observed condition).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Landing gear appears up.”\n“Landing gear appears down and in place.”\n“Rear baggage door appears open.”\nSURFACE AREA RESTRICTIONS\nIf traffic conditions permit, approve a pilot's request to cross Class C or Class D surface areas or exceed the Class C or Class D airspace speed limit. Do not, however, approve a speed in excess of 250 knots (288 mph) unless the pilot informs you a higher minimum speed is required.\nNOTE-\n14 CFR section 91.117 permits speeds in excess of 250 knots (288 mph) when so required or recommended in the airplane flight manual or required by normal military operating procedures.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-16, Surface Areas.\nDo not approve a pilot's request or ask a pilot to conduct unusual maneuvers within surface areas of Class B, C, or D airspace if they are not essential to the performance of the flight.\nEXCEPTION. A pilot's request to conduct aerobatic practice activities may be approved, when operating in accordance with a letter of agreement, and the activity will have no adverse effect on safety of the air traffic operation or result in a reduction of service to other users.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-4-8, Aerobatic Practice Areas.\nNOTE-\nThese unusual maneuvers include unnecessary low passes, unscheduled flybys, practice instrument approaches to altitudes below specified minima (unless a landing or touch‐and‐go is to be made), or any so‐called “buzz jobs” wherein a flight is conducted at a low altitude and/or a high rate of speed for thrill purposes. Such maneuvers increase hazards to persons and property and contribute to noise complaints.\nVISUALLY SCANNING RUNWAYS\nLocal controllers must visually scan runways to the maximum extent possible.\nGround control must assist local control in visually scanning runways, especially when runways are in close proximity to other movement areas.\nESTABLISHING TWO-WAY COMMUNICATIONS\nPilots are required to establish two-way radio communications before entering the Class D airspace. If the controller responds to a radio call with, “(a/c call sign) standby,” radio communications have been established and the pilot can enter the Class D airspace. If workload or traffic conditions prevent immediate provision of airport traffic control services, inform the pilot to remain outside the Class D airspace until conditions permit the services to be provided.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(A/c call sign) REMAIN OUTSIDE DELTA AIRSPACE AND STANDBY.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nGROUND OPERATIONS WHEN VOLCANIC ASH IS PRESENT\nWhen volcanic ash is present on the airport surface, and to the extent possible:\nAvoid requiring aircraft to come to a full stop while taxiing.\nProvide for a rolling takeoff for all departures.\nNOTE-\nWhen aircraft begin a taxi or takeoff roll on ash contaminated surfaces, large amounts of volcanic ash will again become airborne. This newly airborne ash will significantly reduce visibility and will be ingested by the engines of following aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 7-5-9, Flight Operations in Volcanic Ash.\nGROUND OPERATIONS RELATED TO THREE/FOUR-HOUR TARMAC RULE\nWhen a request is made by the pilot-in-command of an aircraft to return to the ramp, gate, or alternate deplaning area due to the Three/Four-Hour Tarmac Rule:\nProvide the requested services as soon as operationally practical, or\nAdvise the pilot‐in‐command that the requested service cannot be accommodated because it would create a significant disruption to air traffic operations.\nNOTE-\nFacility procedures, including actions that constitute a significant disruption, vary by airport and must be identified in the facility directive pertaining to the Three/Four-Hour Tarmac Rule.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification) TAXI TO (ramp, gate, or alternate deplaning area) VIA (route).\nor\n(Identification) EXPECT A (number) MINUTE DELAY DUE TO (ground and/or landing and/or departing) TRAFFIC,\nor\n(Identification) UNABLE DUE TO OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION.\nREFERENCE-\nDOT Rule, Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections, 14 CFR Part 259, commonly referred to as the Three/Four‐Hour Tarmac Rule.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Airport ConditionsLANDING AREA CONDITION\nIf you observe or are informed of any condition which affects the safe use of a landing area:\nNOTE-\nThe airport management/military operations office is responsible for observing and reporting the condition of the landing area.\nIt is the responsibility of the agency operating the airport to provide the tower with current information regarding airport conditions.\nA disabled aircraft on a runway, after occupants are clear, is normally handled by flight standards and airport management/military operations office personnel in the same manner as any obstruction; e.g., construction equipment.\nRelay the information to the airport manager/military operations office concerned.\nCopy verbatim any information received and record the name of the person submitting it.\nConfirm information obtained from other than authorized airport or FAA personnel unless this function is the responsibility of the military operations office.\nNOTE-\nCivil airport managers are required to provide a list of airport employees who are authorized to issue information concerning conditions affecting the safe use of the airport.\nIf you are unable to contact the airport management or operator, issue a NOTAM publicizing an unsafe condition and inform the management or operator as soon as practicable.\nEXAMPLE-\n“DISABLED AIRCRAFT ON RUNWAY.''\nNOTE-\nLegally, only the airport management/military operations office can close a runway.\nMilitary controllers are not authorized to issue NOTAMs. It is the responsibility of the military operations office.\nRunway Condition Codes (RwyCC).\nFurnish RwyCC, as received from the Airport Operator, to aircraft via the ATIS.\nUse the runway number, followed by the RwyCC, for each of the three runway segments, and include the time of the report.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two-Seven, condition codes two, two, three at one zero one eight zulu.”\nWhen an update to the RwyCC is provided, verbally issue to all aircraft until the ATIS broadcast can be updated.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway (number) condition codes two, three, one.”\nREFERENCE-\nAdvisory Circular AC 150/5200-30D, Airport Winter Safety and Operations\nIssue FICON NOTAMs upon pilot request, workload permitting.\nIn the absence of RwyCC, issue to aircraft only factual information, as reported by the airport operator or pilots concerning the condition of the runway surface, describing the accumulation of precipitation.\nEXAMPLE-\n“All runways covered by compacted snow 6 inches deep.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nCLOSED/UNSAFE RUNWAY INFORMATION\nIf an aircraft requests to takeoff, land, or touch‐and‐go on a closed or unsafe runway, inform the pilot the runway is closed or unsafe, and\nIf the pilot persists in his/her request, quote him/her the appropriate parts of the NOTAM applying to the runway and inform him/her that a clearance cannot be issued.\nThen, if the pilot insists and in your opinion the intended operation would not adversely affect other traffic, inform him/her that the operation will be at his/her own risk.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (runway number) CLOSED/UNSAFE.\nIf appropriate, (quote NOTAM information),\nUNABLE TO ISSUE DEPARTURE/LANDING/TOUCH-AND-GO CLEARANCE.\nDEPARTURE/LANDING/TOUCH-AND-GO WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nExcept as permitted by paragraph 4-8-7, Side-Step Maneuver, where parallel runways are served by separate ILS systems and one of the runways is closed, the ILS associated with the closed runway should not be used for approaches unless not using the ILS would have an adverse impact on the operational efficiency of the airport.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-5, Landing Clearance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nTIMELY INFORMATION\nIssue airport condition information necessary for an aircraft's safe operation in time for it to be useful to the pilot. Include the following, as appropriate:\nConstruction work on or immediately adjacent to the movement area.\nRough portions of the movement area.\nBraking conditions caused by ice, snow, slush, or water.\nSnowdrifts or piles of snow on or along the edges of the area and the extent of any plowed area.\nParked aircraft on the movement area.\nIrregular operation of part or all of the airport lighting system.\nVolcanic ash on any airport surface area and whether the ash is wet or dry (if known).\nNOTE-\nBraking action on wet ash may be degraded. Dry ash on the runway may necessitate minimum use of reverse thrust.\nOther pertinent airport conditions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-9, Reporting Essential Flight Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nBRAKING ACTION\nFurnish quality of braking action, as received from pilots, to all aircraft as follows:\nDescribe the quality of braking action using the terms “good,\" “good to medium,\" “medium,\" “medium to poor,\" “poor,\" or “nil.\" If the pilot reports braking action in other than the approved terms, ask him/her to categorize braking action in these terms.\nNOTE-\nThe term “nil” is used to indicate bad or no braking action.\nInclude type of aircraft from which the report is received.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Braking action medium, reported by a heavy Boeing Seven Sixty-Seven.”\n“Braking action poor, reported by a Boeing Seven Thirty-Seven.”\nIf the braking action report affects only a portion of a runway, obtain enough information from the pilot to describe the braking action in terms easily understood by other pilots.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Braking action poor first half of runway, reported by a Boeing Seven Fifty-Seven.”\n“Braking action good to medium beyond the intersection of Runway Two Seven, reported by an Airbus Three Twenty-One.”\nNOTE-\nDescriptive terms, such as the first or the last half of the runway, should normally be used rather than landmark descriptions, such as opposite the fire station, south of a taxiway, etc. Landmarks extraneous to the landing runway are difficult to distinguish during low visibility, at night, or anytime a pilot is busy landing an aircraft.\nIssue the runway surface condition and/or the Runway Condition Reading (RCR), if provided, to all USAF and ANG aircraft. Issue the RCR to other aircraft upon pilot request.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Ice on runway, RCR zero five, patchy.”\nNOTE-\nUSAF offices furnish RCR information at airports serving USAF and ANG aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-5, Braking Action Advisories.\nBRAKING ACTION ADVISORIES\nWhen runway braking action reports are received from pilots which include the terms “medium,\" “poor,\" or “nil,\" or whenever weather conditions are conducive to deteriorating or rapidly changing runway conditions, include on the ATIS broadcast the statement “Braking Action Advisories are in effect.\"\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-4-1, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).\nDuring the time Braking Action Advisories are in effect, take the following action:\nIssue the latest braking action report for the runway in use to each arriving and departing aircraft early enough to be of benefit to the pilot. When possible, include reports from super or heavy aircraft when the arriving or departing aircraft is a super or heavy.\nIf no report has been received for the runway of intended use, issue an advisory to that effect.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nNO BRAKING ACTION REPORTS RECEIVED FOR RUNWAY (runway number).\nAdvise the Airport Operator that runway braking action reports of “good to medium,\" “medium,\" “medium to poor,\" “poor,\" or “nil\" have been received.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-1, Letters of Agreement.\nSolicit PIREPs of runway braking action.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para, 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-1, Departure Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-1, Landing Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-2, PIREP Solicitation and Dissemination.\nARRESTING SYSTEM OPERATION\nFor normal operations, arresting systems remotely controlled by ATC must remain in the retracted or down position.\nNOTE-\nUSN- Runway Arresting Gear- barriers are not operated by ATC personnel. Readiness/rigging of the equipment is the responsibility of the operations department.\nA request to raise a barrier or hook cable means the barrier or cable on the departure end of the runway. If an approach end engagement is required, the pilot or military authority will specifically request that the approach end cable be raised.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 1, Aircraft Arresting System, Single Frequency Approach (SFA), Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations, Celestial Navigation (CELNAV) Training.\nRaise aircraft arresting systems whenever:\nRequested by a pilot.\nNOTE-\nThe standard emergency phraseology for a pilot requesting an arresting system to be raised for immediate engagement is:\n“BARRIER - BARRIER - BARRIER”\nor\n“CABLE - CABLE - CABLE.”\nRequested by military authority; e.g., airfield manager, supervisor of flying, mobile control officer, etc.\nNOTE-\nUSAF. Arresting Systems at the departure end of the runway may remain in the up position when requested by the senior operational commander. The IFR Enroute Supplement and AP‐1 will describe specific barrier configuration. ATC will advise transient aircraft of the barrier configuration using the phraseology in subparagraph c, below.\nA military jet aircraft is landing with known or suspected radio failure or conditions (drag chute/hydraulic/electrical failure, etc.) that indicate an arresting system may be needed. Exceptions are authorized for military aircraft which cannot engage an arresting system (C-9, C-141, C-5, T-39, etc.) and should be identified in a letter of agreement and/or appropriate military directive.\nWhen requested by military authority due to freezing weather conditions or malfunction of the activating mechanism, the barrier/cable may remain in a raised position provided aircraft are advised.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nYOUR DEPARTURE/LANDING WILL BE TOWARD/OVER A RAISED BARRIER/CABLE ON RUNWAY (number), (location, distance, as appropriate).\nInform civil and U.S. Army aircraft whenever rubber supported cables are in place at the approach end of the landing runway, and include the distance of the cables from the threshold. This information may be omitted if it is published in the Domestic Notices webpage, International Notices webpage, or the DoD FLIP.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway One Four arresting cable one thousand feet from threshold.”\nWhen arresting system operation has been requested, inform the pilot of the indicated barrier/cable position.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification), BARRIER/CABLE INDICATES UP/DOWN. CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF/TO LAND.\nTime permitting, advise pilots of the availability of all arresting systems on the runway in question when a pilot requests barrier information.\nIf an aircraft engages a raised barrier/cable, initiate crash alarm procedures immediately.\nFor preplanned practice engagements not associated with emergencies, crash alarm systems need not be activated if, in accordance with local military operating procedures, all required notifications are made before the practice engagement.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nFAR FIELD MONITOR (FFM) REMOTE STATUS UNIT\nTo meet the demand for more facilities capable of operating under CAT III weather, Type II equipment is being upgraded to Integrity Level 3. This integrity level will support operations which place a high degree of reliance on ILS guidance for positioning through touchdown.\nInstallation of the FFM remote status indicating units is necessary to attain the integrity necessary to meet internationally agreed upon reliability values in support of CAT III operations on Type II ILS equipment. The remote status indicating unit used in conjunction with Type II equipment adds a third integrity test; thereby, producing an approach aid which has integrity capable of providing Level 3 service.\nThe remote status sensing unit, when installed in the tower cab, will give immediate indications of localizer out‐of‐tolerance conditions. The alarm in the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates an inoperative or an out‐of‐tolerance localizer signal; e.g., the course may have shifted due to equipment malfunction or vehicle/aircraft encroachment into the critical area.\nOperation of the FFM remote sensing unit will be based on the prevailing weather. The FFM remote sensing unit must be operational when the weather is below CAT II ILS minimums.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 6750.24, Appendix A, Abnormal Checklist\nWhen the remote status unit indicates that the localizer FFM is in alarm (aural warning following the preset delay) and:\nThe aircraft is outside the middle marker (MM) or in the absence of a MM, ½ mile final, check for encroachment of those portions of the critical area that can be seen from the tower. It is understood that the entire critical area may not be visible due to low ceilings and poor visibility. The check is strictly to determine possible causal factors for the out-of-tolerance situation. If the alarm has not cleared prior to the aircraft's arriving at the MM or in the absence of a MM, ½ mile final, immediately issue an advisory that the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates the localizer is unreliable.\nThe aircraft is between the MM or ½ mile final and the inner marker (IM), or if the IM is not installed, the CAT II Missed Approach Point (MAP), immediately issue an advisory that the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates the localizer is unreliable.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCAUTION, MONITOR INDICATES RUNWAY (number) LOCALIZER UNRELIABLE.\nThe aircraft has passed the IM or the CAT II MAP (if the IM is not installed) there is no action requirement. Although the FFM has been modified with filters which dampen the effect of false alarms, you may expect alarms when aircraft are located between the FFM and the localizer antenna either on landing or on takeoff.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Airport Surface Detection ProceduresEQUIPMENT USAGE\nThe operational status of ASDE systems must be determined during the relief briefing, or as soon as possible after assuming responsibility for the associated position.\nUse ASDE systems to augment visual observation of aircraft landing or departing, and aircraft or vehicular movements on runways and taxiways, or other parts of the movement area.\nASDE systems with safety logic must be operated continuously.\nASDE systems without safety logic must be operated:\nContinuously between sunset and sunrise.\nWhen visibility is less than the most distant point in the active movement area, or\nWhen, in your judgment, its use will assist you in the performance of your duties at any time.\nNOTE-\nRadar‐only mode is an enhancement of the ASDE-X and ASSC systems that allows the system to stay operational with safety logic processing during a simultaneous loss of the Multilateration (MLAT) subsystem and ADS-B data or loss of ADS-B data when MLAT is not present. The system stays in full core alert status under radar‐only mode but without automatic data block capability.\nIDENTIFICATION\nTo identify an observed target/track on an ASDE system display, correlate its position with one or more of the following:\nPilot/vehicle operator position report.\nController's visual observation.\nAn identified target observed on the ASR or CTRD.\nAn observed target/track on an ASDE system display may be identified as a false target by visual observation. If the area containing a suspected false target is not visible from the tower, an airport operations vehicle or pilots of aircraft operating in the area may be used to conduct the visual observation.\nAfter positive verification that a target is false, through pilot/vehicle operator position report or controller visual observation, the track may be temporarily dropped, which will remove the target from the display and safety logic processing. A notation must be made to FAA Form 7230-4, Daily Record of Facility Operation, when a track is temporarily dropped.\nINFORMATION USAGE\nASDE system derived information may be used to:\nFormulate clearances and control instructions to aircraft and vehicles on the movement area.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-2, ATC Surveillance Source Use.\nPosition aircraft and vehicles using the movement area.\nDetermine the exact location of aircraft and vehicles, or spatial relationship to other aircraft/vehicles on the movement area.\nMonitor compliance with control instructions by aircraft and vehicles on taxiways and runways.\nConfirm pilot reported positions.\nProvide directional taxi information, as appropriate.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTURN (left/right) ON THE TAXIWAY/RUNWAY YOU ARE APPROACHING.\nDo not provide specific navigational guidance (exact headings to be followed) unless an emergency exists or by mutual agreement with the pilot.\nNOTE-\nIt remains the pilot's responsibility to navigate visually via routes to the clearance limit specified by the controller and to avoid other parked or taxiing aircraft, vehicles, or persons in the movement area.\nDo not allow an aircraft to begin departure roll or cross the landing threshold whenever there is an unidentified target/track displayed on the runway.\nSAFETY LOGIC ALERT RESPONSES\nWhen the system generates an alert, the controller must immediately assess the situation visually and as presented on the ASDE system display, then take appropriate action as follows:\nWhen an arrival aircraft (still airborne, prior to the landing threshold) activates a warning alert, the controller must issue go‐around instructions. (Exception: Alerts involving known formation flights, as they cross the landing threshold, may be disregarded if all other factors are acceptable.)\nNOTE-\nThe intent of this paragraph is that an aircraft does not land on the runway, on that approach, when the safety logic system has generated a warning alert. A side-step maneuver or circle to land on another runway satisfies this requirement.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-8-1, Sequence/Spacing Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-6, Same Runway Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-3, Same Runway Separation.\nP/CG Term - GO AROUND.\nWhen an arrival aircraft activates a warning alert to a taxiway, the controller must issue go-around instructions.\nWhen two arrival aircraft, or an arrival aircraft and a departing aircraft activate an alert, the controller will issue go-around instructions or take appropriate action to ensure intersecting runway separation is maintained.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-8, Intersecting Runway/Intersecting Flight Path Operations.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-4, Intersecting Runway/Intersecting Flight Path Separation.\nFor other safety logic system alerts, issue instructions/clearances based on good judgment and evaluation of the situation at hand.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Taxi and Ground Movement ProceduresGROUND TRAFFIC MOVEMENT\nIssue by radio or directional light signals specific instructions which approve or disapprove the movement of aircraft, vehicles, equipment, or personnel on the movement area except where permitted in an LOA.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-1, Letters of Agreement.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-2, Appropriate Subjects.\nDo not issue conditional instructions that are dependent upon the movement of an arrival aircraft on or approaching the runway or a departure aircraft established on a takeoff roll. Do not say, “Line up and wait behind landing traffic,” or “Taxi/proceed across Runway Three-Six behind departing/landing Citation.” The above requirements do not preclude issuing instructions to follow an aircraft observed to be operating on the movement area in accordance with an ATC clearance/instruction and in such a manner that the instructions to follow are not ambiguous.\nDo not issue unconditional instructions when authorizing movement on a runway/taxiway for the purpose of airfield checks or other airport operations. Instructions must ensure positive control with specific instructions to proceed on a runway or movement area, and as necessary, hold short instructions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-3, Use of Active Runways.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Airport 1, proceed on Runway 26R, hold short of Runway 18L.”\n“Airport 1 proceed on taxi way B, hold short of Runway18L.\"\n“Airport 1 proceed on Runway 26R.” (additional instructions as necessary.)\nNOTE-\nThe following are examples of unconditional instructions and are not approved for use: “THE FIELD IS YOURS,” “CLEARED ON ALL SURFACES,” “THE AIRPORT IS YOURS,” and “PROCEED ON ALL RUNWAYS AND TAXIWAYS.”\n“PROCEED AS REQUESTED\" is not approved phraseology for instructing aircraft, vehicles, equipment, or personnel to cross or operate on a runway.\nDo not use the word “cleared” in conjunction with authorization for aircraft to taxi or equipment/vehicle/personnel operations. Use the prefix “taxi,” “proceed,” or “hold,” as appropriate, for aircraft instructions and “proceed” or “hold” for equipment/vehicles/personnel.\nIntersection departures may be initiated by a controller or a controller may authorize an intersection departure if a pilot requests. Issue the measured distance from the intersection to the runway end rounded “down” to the nearest 50 feet to any pilot who requests and to all military aircraft, unless use of the intersection is covered in appropriate directives.\nNOTE-\nExceptions are authorized where specific military aircraft routinely make intersection takeoffs and procedures are defined in appropriate directives. The authority exercising operational control of such aircraft ensures that all pilots are thoroughly familiar with these procedures, including the usable runway length from the applicable intersection.\nSome airports publish “declared distances” for a particular runway. These are published in the Chart Supplement or the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) and there is no requirement that facility personnel be aware of them. These distances are a means of satisfying airport design criteria and are intended to be used by pilots and/or operators for preflight performance planning only. There are no special markings, signing, or lighting associated with declared distances and they do not limit the actual runway available for use by an aircraft. Therefore, they cannot be used for any air traffic control purpose.

The taxi clearance/route must include the specific route to follow. When a taxi clearance to a runway is issued to an aircraft, confirm the aircraft has the correct runway assignment.\nNOTE-\nA pilot's read back of taxi instructions with the runway assignment can be considered confirmation of runway assignment.\nMovement of aircraft or vehicles on nonmovement areas is the responsibility of the pilot, the aircraft operator, or the airport management.\nWhen authorizing an aircraft to taxi or a vehicle to proceed on the movement area, specify the taxi instructions/route. If it is the intent to hold the aircraft/vehicle short of:\nA runway: issue the route up to the runway hold short point. When issuing a runway crossing clearance, include specific instructions on where to cross the runway;\nAny other point along the route, issue:\nthe route up to the hold short point, or\nthe entire route and then state the hold short instructions.\nAfter issuing a crossing clearance, specify the taxi instructions/route an aircraft/vehicle is to follow, if not previously issued.\nNOTE-\nThe absence of holding instructions authorizes an aircraft/vehicle to cross all taxiways that intersect the taxi route.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD POSITION.\nHOLD FOR (reason)\nCROSS (runway), at (runway/taxiway)\nor\nTAXI/CONTINUE TAXIING/PROCEED VIA (route),\nor\nON (runway number or taxiways, etc.),\nor\nTO (location),\nor\n(direction),\nor\nACROSS RUNWAY (number), at (runway/taxiway).\nor\nVIA (route), HOLD SHORT OF (location)\nor\nFOLLOW (traffic) (restrictions as necessary)\nor\nBEHIND (traffic).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cross Runway Two-Eight Left, at taxiway Alpha,  hold short of Runway Two-Eight Right.”\n“Taxi/continue taxiing/proceed to the hangar.”\n“Taxi/continue taxiing/proceed straight ahead then via ramp to the hangar.”\n“Taxi/continue taxiing/proceed on Taxiway Charlie, hold short of Runway Two-Seven.”\nor\n“Taxi/continue taxing/proceed on Charlie, hold short of Runway Two-Seven.”\nWhen authorizing an aircraft to taxi to an assigned takeoff runway, state the departure runway followed by the specific taxi route. Issue hold short instructions, in accordance with subparagraph a above, when an aircraft will be required to hold short of a runway or other points along the taxi route.\nNOTE-\nIf the specific taxi route ends into a connecting taxiway with the same identifier (for example, taxiway “A” connects with Taxiway “A1”) at the approach end of the runway, the connecting taxiway may be omitted from the clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number), TAXI VIA (route as necessary).\nor\nRUNWAY (number), TAXI VIA (route as necessary)(hold short instructions as necessary).”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Three-Six Left, taxi via taxiway Alpha, hold short of taxiway Charlie.”\nor\n“Runway Three-Six Left, taxi via Alpha, hold short of Charlie.”\nor\n“Runway Three-Six Left, taxi via taxiway Alpha, hold short of Runway Two-Seven Right.”\nor\n“Runway Three-Six Left, taxi via Charlie, cross Runway Two-Seven Left, hold short of Runway Two-Seven Right.”\nor\n“Runway Three-Six Left, taxi via Alpha, Charlie, cross Runway One-Zero.”\nIssue a crossing clearance to aircraft for each runway their route crosses. An aircraft must have crossed a previous runway before another runway crossing clearance may be issued. At those airports where the taxi distance between runway centerlines is 1,300 feet or less, multiple runway crossings may be issued with a single clearance. The air traffic manager must submit a request to the appropriate Service Area Director of Air Traffic Operations and receive approval before authorizing multiple runway crossings.\nNOTE-\nControllers should avoid crossing points that are not perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the runway to be crossed, (for example, reverse high speed taxiways).\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“Cross (runway) at (runway/taxiway), hold short of (runway)”, or\nCross (runways) at (runway/taxiway).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cross Runway One-Six Left at Taxiway Bravo, hold short of Runway One-Six Right.”\n“Cross Runway One-Six Left and Runway One-Six Right at Taxiway Bravo.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-11 Multiple Runway Crossings.\nWhen an aircraft/vehicle is instructed to “follow” traffic and requires a runway crossing, issue a runway crossing clearance in addition to the follow instructions and/or hold short instructions, as applicable.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Follow (traffic), cross Runway Two-Seven Right, at Taxiway Whiskey”\nor\n“Follow (traffic), cross Runway Two Seven-Right  at Taxiway Whiskey, hold short of Runway Two-Seven Left.”\nIssue a crossing clearance to vehicles for each runway their route crosses. A vehicle must have crossed a previous runway before another runway crossing clearance may be issued.\nNOTE-\nA clearance is required for vehicles to operate on any active, inactive, or closed runway except for vehicles operating on closed runways in accordance with a Letter of Agreement (LOA).\nVehicles that have been issued a clearance onto a runway to conduct runway operations are authorized to cross intersecting runways, unless otherwise restricted. Issue hold short instructions as needed.\nNOTE-\nVehicles should not normally use runways as transition routes to other parts of the airfield.  These movements are not considered runway operations and the use of alternative routes is preferred.\nCrossing of active runway(s) by aircraft/vehicle(s):\nDuring departure operations, ensure that aircraft/vehicles intending to cross a runway do not cross the runway holding position markings until the controller visually observes the departure aircraft in a turn, or the departure aircraft has passed the point where the crossing aircraft/vehicle is located, regardless of altitude, unless authorized in FAA Order JO 7110.65, paragraph 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Runway Position Holding Markings, Subpara 2-3-5a.\nFAA Order 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nDuring arrival operations, ensure the following:\nAn aircraft/vehicle has completed crossing prior to an arriving aircraft crossing the landing threshold, or\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nAn aircraft/vehicle must not cross the runway holding position markings until an arriving aircraft has completed landing roll and:\nAcknowledged the instruction to exit the runway prior to the point at which the crossing is intended, or\nAcknowledged the instruction to hold short of the point at which the crossing is intended, or\nVisually observed exiting the runway prior to the point at which the crossing is intended, or\nPassed the point at which the crossing is intended.\nLAHSO application: When the arriving aircraft has acknowledged a clearance to land and hold short in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.118, Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO), an aircraft/vehicle may cross the runway beyond the arriving aircraft's hold short point.

Unless the arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight or is circling to land to another runway, do not authorize vehicles/aircraft to operate in or over the critical area, except as specified in subparagraph a1, whenever an arriving aircraft is inside the ILS outer marker (OM) or the fix used in lieu of the OM.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD SHORT OF (runway) ILS CRITICAL AREA.\nNOTE-\nWhen available weather sources such as METARs/SPECI/PIREPs/controller observations indicate weather conditions are changing from VFR to IFR and are deteriorating, actions are expected to be taken to update the official weather observation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-2 PIREP Solicitation and Dissemination.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-3, Reporting Weather Conditions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-5, Disseminating Official Weather Information.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-9-2, Receipt and Dissemination of Weather Observations.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-1, SIGMENT and PIREP Handling.\nFAA Order JO 7900.5, Para 6.4d, Equipment for Sky Condition.\nFAA Order 6750.16, Siting Criteria for Instrument Landing Systems.\nLOCALIZER CRITICAL AREA\nDo not authorize vehicle or aircraft operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside the ILS OM or the fix used in lieu of the OM when the official weather observation is a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles, except:\nA preceding arriving aircraft on the same or another runway that passes over or through the area while landing or exiting the runway.\nA preceding departing aircraft or missed approach on the same or another runway that passes through or over the area.\nIn addition to subparagraph a1(a), when the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of less than 200 feet or RVR 2,000 feet, do not authorize vehicles or aircraft operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside the middle marker, or in the absence of a middle marker, 1/2 mile final.\nGLIDESLOPE CRITICAL AREA. Do not authorize vehicles or aircraft operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside the ILS OM or the fix used in lieu of the OM unless the arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight or is circling to land on another runway when the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles.\nOperators commonly conduct “coupled” or “autoland” approaches to satisfy maintenance, training, or reliability program requirements. Promptly issue an advisory if the critical area will not be protected when an arriving aircraft advises that a “coupled,” “CATIII,” “autoland,” or similar type approach will be conducted and the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of 800 feet or more, or the visibility is 2 miles or more.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nILS CRITICAL AREA NOT PROTECTED.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) is authorized to define criteria for protection of precision approach critical areas at military controlled airports. This protection is provided to all aircraft operating at that military controlled airport. Waiver authority for DoD precision approach critical area criteria rests with the appropriate military authority.\nNOTE-\nSigns and markings are installed by the airport operator to define the ILS critical area. No point along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is permitted past the hold line for holding purposes. The operator is responsible to properly position the aircraft, vehicle, or equipment at the appropriate hold line/sign or designated point. The requirements in paragraph 3-1-12, Visually Scanning Runways, remain valid as appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nAC150/5340-1, Standards for Airport Markings.\nPRECISION OBSTACLE FREE ZONE (POFZ) AND FINAL APPROACH OBSTACLE CLEARANCE SURFACES (OCS)\nEnsure the POFZ is clear of traffic (aircraft or vehicles) when an aircraft on a vertically-guided final approach is within 2 miles of the runway threshold and the official weather observation indicates the ceiling is below 300 feet or visibility is less than 3/4 SM to protect aircraft executing a missed approach.\nNOTE-\nOnly horizontal surfaces (e.g., the wings) can penetrate the POFZ, but not the vertical surfaces (e.g., fuselage or tail). Three hundred feet (300) is used because ATC does not measure ceilings in fifty (50) foot increments.\nEnsure the final approach OCS (e.g., ILS /LPV W, X, and Y surfaces) are clear of aircraft/vehicles when an aircraft on the vertically-guided approach is within 2 miles of the runway threshold and the official weather observation indicates the ceiling is below 800 feet or visibility is less than 2 SM to protect aircraft executing a missed approach.\nNOTE-\nThe POFZ and the close-in portion of the final approach obstacle clearance surfaces protect aircraft executing a missed approach.\nVehicles that are less than 10 feet in height, necessary for the maintenance of the airport and/or navigation facilities operating outside the movement area, are exempt.\nIf it is not possible to clear the POFZ or OCS prior to an aircraft reaching a point 2 miles from the runway threshold and the weather is less than described in subparagraph a or b above, issue traffic to the landing aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThe POFZ and/or OCS must be cleared as soon as practical.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(ACID), IN THE EVENT OF MISSED APPROACH (issue traffic).\nTAXIING AIRCRAFT/VEHICLE LEFT/RIGHT OF RUNWAY.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United 623, in the event of missed approach, taxiing aircraft right of runway.”\n“Delta 1058, in the event of missed approach, vehicle left of runway.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-6, Traffic Information.\nAC 150/5300-13, Airport Design.\nFIG 3-7-1Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ)\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Arrival Procedures and SeparationLANDING INFORMATION\nProvide current landing information, as appropriate, to arriving aircraft. Landing information contained in the ATIS broadcast may be omitted if the pilot states the appropriate ATIS code. Runway, wind, and altimeter may be omitted if a pilot uses the phrase “have numbers.” Issue landing information by including the following:\nNOTE-\nPilot use of “have numbers” does not indicate receipt of the ATIS broadcast.\nSpecific traffic pattern information (may be omitted if the aircraft is to circle the airport to the left).\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nENTER LEFT/RIGHT BASE.\nSTRAIGHT-IN.\nMAKE STRAIGHT-IN.\nSTRAIGHT-IN APPROVED.\nRIGHT TRAFFIC.\nMAKE RIGHT TRAFFIC.\nRIGHT TRAFFIC APPROVED.\nCONTINUE.\nNOTE-\nAdditional information should normally be issued with instructions to continue. Example: “continue, report one mile final”; “continue, expect landing clearance two mile final”; etc.\nRunway in use.\nSurface wind.\nAltimeter setting.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-7-1, Current Settings.\nAny supplementary information.\nClearance to land.\nRequests for additional position reports. Use prominent geographical fixes which can be easily recognized from the air, preferably those depicted on sectional charts. This does not preclude the use of the legs of the traffic pattern as reporting points.\nNOTE-\nAt some locations, VFR checkpoints are depicted on sectional aeronautical and terminal area charts. In selecting geographical fixes, depicted VFR checkpoints are preferred unless the pilot exhibits a familiarity with the local area.\nCeiling and visibility if either is below basic VFR minima.\nLow level wind shear or microburst advisories when available.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-8, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories.\nIssue braking action for the runway in use as received from pilots when braking action advisories are in effect.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-5, Braking Action Advisories.\nRunway Condition Codes. Furnish RwyCC, as received from the Airport Operator, to aircraft via the ATIS.\nFor opposite direction arrival operations, controllers may verbally issue the RwyCC, as identified in the FICON NOTAM, in reverse order. Controllers must not include reversed RwyCC on the ATIS broadcast.\nIf the pilot does not indicate the appropriate ATIS code, and when a runway has been shortened, controllers must ensure that pilots receive the runway number combined with a shortened announcement for all arriving aircraft.\nFORWARDING APPROACH INFORMATION BY NONAPPROACH CONTROL FACILITIES\nForward the following, as appropriate, to the control facility having IFR jurisdiction in your area. You may eliminate those items that, because of local conditions or situations, are fully covered in a letter of agreement or a facility directive.\nWhen you clear an arriving aircraft for a visual approach.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-4-1, Visual Approach.\nAircraft arrival time.\nCancellation of IFR flight plan.\nInformation on a missed approach, unreported, or overdue aircraft.\nRunway in use.\nWeather as required.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-3, Reporting Weather Conditions.\nWhen the weather is below 1,000 feet or 3 miles or the highest circling minimums, whichever is greater, issue current weather to aircraft executing an instrument approach if it changes from that on the ATIS or that previously forwarded to the center/approach control.\nSAME RUNWAY SEPARATION\nSeparate an arriving aircraft from another aircraft using the same runway by ensuring that the arriving aircraft does not cross the landing threshold until one of the following conditions exists or unless authorized in paragraph 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nThe other aircraft has landed and is clear of the runway. (See FIG 3-10-1.) Between sunrise and sunset, if you can determine distances by reference to suitable landmarks and the other aircraft has landed, it need not be clear of the runway if the following minimum distance from the landing threshold exists:\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nFIG 3-10-1Same Runway Separation\nWhen a Category I aircraft is landing behind a Category I or II- 3,000 feet.\n(See FIG 3-10-2.)\nFIG 3-10-2Same Runway Separation\nWhen a Category II aircraft is landing behind a Category I or II- 4,500 feet.\n(See FIG 3-10-3.)\nFIG 3-10-3Same Runway Separation\nThe other aircraft has departed and crossed the runway end. (See FIG 3-10-4). If you can determine distances by reference to suitable landmarks and the other aircraft is airborne, it need not have crossed the runway end if the following minimum distance from the landing threshold exists:\nCategory I aircraft landing behind Category I or II- 3,000 feet.\nCategory II aircraft landing behind Category I or II- 4,500 feet.\nWhen either is a category III aircraft- 6,000 feet.  (See FIG 3-10-5.)\nFIG 3-10-4Same Runway Separation\nFIG 3-10-5Same Runway Separation\nWhen the succeeding aircraft is a helicopter, visual separation may be applied in lieu of using distance minima.\nWAKE TURBULENCE APPLICATION\nIssue wake turbulence advisories, and the position, altitude if known, and the direction of flight of:\nThe super or heavy to aircraft landing behind a departing/arriving super or heavy on the same or parallel runways separated by less than 2,500 feet.\nThe B757/large aircraft to a small aircraft landing behind a departing/arriving B757/large aircraft on the same or parallel runways separated by less than 2,500 feet.\nREFERENCE-\nAC 90-23, Aircraft Wake Turbulence, Para 12, Pilot Responsibility.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway two seven left cleared to land, caution wake turbulence, heavy Boeing 747 departing runway two seven right.”\n“Number two follow Boeing 757 on 2‐mile final. Caution wake turbulence.”\n“Traffic, heavy Airbus 310 on 2‐mile final to the parallel runway, runway two six right, cleared to land. Caution wake turbulence.”\nINTERSECTING RUNWAY/INTERSECTING FLIGHT PATH OPERATIONS\nIssue traffic information to each aircraft operating on intersecting runways.\nSeparate an arriving aircraft using one runway from another aircraft using an intersecting runway or a nonintersecting runway when the flight paths intersect by ensuring that the arriving aircraft does not cross the landing threshold or flight path of the other aircraft until one of the following conditions exists:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 3-10-4, Intersecting Runway/Intersecting Flight Path Separation and 5-5-4, Minima (2021-06-09)\nThe preceding aircraft has departed and passed the intersection/flight path or is airborne and turning to avert any conflict. (See FIG 3-10-6 and FIG 3-10-7.)\nFIG 3-10-6Intersecting Runway Separation\nFIG 3-10-7Intersecting Runway Separation\nA preceding arriving aircraft is clear of the landing runway, completed landing roll and will hold short of the intersection/flight path, or has passed the intersection/flight path. (See FIG 3-10-8 and FIG 3-10-9.)\nFIG 3-10-8Intersection Runway Separation\nFIG 3-10-9Intersection Runway Separation\nNOTE-\nWhen visual separation is being applied by the tower, appropriate control instructions and traffic advisories must be issued to ensure go around or missed approaches avert any conflict with the flight path of traffic on the other runway.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation, Subpara a2.\nUSA/USAF/USN NOT APPLICABLE. An arriving aircraft may be authorized to land and hold short of the intersecting runway/intersecting flight path being used by another departing or arriving aircraft in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.118, Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). The following procedures apply:\nNOTE-\nApplication of these procedures does not relieve controllers from the responsibility of providing other appropriate separation contained in this order.\nInstruct the arriving aircraft to land and hold short of the intersecting runway/intersecting flight path. In the case of simultaneous landings and no operational benefit is lost, restrict the aircraft of the lesser weight category (if known). (See FIG 3-10-10 and FIG 3-10-11.)\nNOTE-\nThe hold short point issued to an arriving aircraft may or may not be the intersecting runway or approach/departure flight path of the other runway. The hold short point may be a taxiway or other predetermined point on the runway that protects the intersecting runway/intersecting flight path.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-5, Landing Clearance.\nFIG 3-10-10Intersecting Runway Separation\nIssue traffic information to both aircraft involved and obtain an acknowledgment from each.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway one eight cleared to land, hold short of runway one four left, traffic, (type aircraft) landing runway one four left.”\n“Runway one four left cleared to land, traffic, (type aircraft) landing runway one eight will hold short of the intersection.”\n“Runway three six cleared to land, hold short of runway three three, traffic, (type aircraft) departing runway three three.”\n“Traffic, (type aircraft) landing runway three six will hold short of the intersection, runway three three cleared for takeoff.”\nThe conditions in subparagraphs b1 and b2 above must be met in sufficient time to take other action, if desired by the pilot(s), and no later than the time landing clearance is issued.\nWAKE TURBULENCE APPLICATION\nSeparate aircraft landing behind a departing aircraft on a crossing runway if the arrival will fly through the airborne path of the departure by the appropriate radar separation or the following interval: (See FIG 3-10-11):\nHeavy, large, or small behind super - 3 minutes.\nHeavy, large, or small behind heavy - 2 minutes.\nSmall behind B757 - 2 minutes.\nIssue wake turbulence cautionary advisories, the position, altitude if known, and direction of flight of the super, heavy, or B757 to:\nREFERENCE-\nAC 90-23, Aircraft Wake Turbulence, Para 11, Pilot Responsibility.\nFIG 3-10-11Intersecting Runway Separation\nAll aircraft landing on a crossing runway behind a departing super or heavy, or a small aircraft landing on a crossing runway behind a departing B757, if the arrival flight path will cross the takeoff path behind the departing aircraft rotation point. (See FIG 3-10-12.)\nFIG 3-10-12Intersecting Runway Separation\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway niner cleared to land. Caution wake turbulence, heavy C-One Forty One departing runway one five.”\nAll VFR aircraft landing on a crossing runway behind an arriving super or heavy, and VFR small aircraft landing on a crossing runway behind a B757, if the arrival flight paths will cross. (See FIG 3-10-13.)\nFIG 3-10-13Intersecting Runway Separation\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway niner cleared to land. Caution wake turbulence, Boeing Seven Fifty Seven landing runway three six.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-4-4, Approaches to Multiple Runways.\nLANDING CLEARANCE\nWhen issuing a clearance to land, first state the runway number followed by the landing clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND.\nUSA/USAF/USN NOT APPLICABLE. When issuing a clearance to land and hold short in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.118, Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO), exchange traffic information as necessary. Request a read back of hold short instructions when not received.\nNOTE-\nPilots who prefer to use the full length of the runway or a runway different from that specified are expected to advise ATC prior to landing.\nPilots may not be able to accept a LAHSO clearance when their aircraft is less than 1,000 feet AGL.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY (number)/TAXIWAY (taxiway)/(approach/departure path)/POINT (predetermined point), (traffic, type aircraft, or other information).\nOr\nREAD BACK HOLD SHORT INSTRUCTIONS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway 7 Left, cleared to land, hold short of taxiway Whiskey, traffic crossing downfield.”\nOr (if hold short instructions are not read back with the landing clearance)\n“Read back hold short instructions.”\n“Runway one eight cleared to land, hold short of runway one four left, traffic, (type aircraft) landing runway one four left.”\n“Runway one six cleared to land, hold short of runway seven left, traffic, (type aircraft) departing runway seven left.”\nIf the landing runway is changed, preface the landing clearance with “change to runway” followed by the runway number. Restate the runway number followed by the landing clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCHANGE TO RUNWAY (number), RUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND.\nNOTE-\nThe purpose of the “change to runway” phraseology and restating the runway number is to emphasize to the pilot that they are being cleared to land on a runway other than what they were expecting.\nWhen you become aware that an aircraft is aligned with the wrong surface, inform the pilot and:\nIssue control instructions/clearances, or\nEXAMPLE-\n“United four twenty three, go‐around, you appear to be aligned with the wrong runway.”\n“American sixty three, go‐around, you appear to be aligned with a taxiway.”\n“Southwest two thirty nine, you appear to be aligned with Runway 27 Left (pertinent information), Runway 27 Left, cleared to land.”\nIf time permits, verify the pilot is aligned with the correct runway. Issue control instructions/clearances as necessary.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Twin Cessna four one four lima bravo, verify you are aligned with Runway 27 Left.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-6-4, Safety Logic Alert Responses.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-8, Withholding Landing Clearance.\nProcedures.\nFacilities without a safety logic system or facilities with the safety logic system inoperative or in the limited configuration must not clear an aircraft for a full‐stop, touch‐and‐go, stop‐and‐go, low approach, or option on the same runway with an aircraft holding in position or taxiing to LUAW until the aircraft in position has exited the runway or starts takeoff roll.\nFacilities using safety logic in the full core alert runway configuration may clear an aircraft for a full‐stop, touch‐and‐go, stop‐and‐go, low approach, or option on the same runway with an aircraft holding in position or taxiing to LUAW except when reported weather conditions are less than ceiling 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles.\nInform the closest aircraft that is requesting a full‐stop, touch‐and‐go, stop‐and‐go, low approach, or option when there is traffic authorized to LUAW on the same runway.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Delta One, Runway One-Eight, continue, traffic holding in position.”\n“Delta One, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land. Traffic holding in position.”\n“Twin Cessna Four Four Golf, Runway One-Niner base approved, traffic holding in position.\"\n“Baron Two Five Foxtrot, Runway One-Niner Right extend downwind, tower will call your base, traffic holding in position.\"\nUSA/USN/USAF. Issue runway identifier along with surface wind when clearing an aircraft to land, touch and go, stop and go, low approach, or the option.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number), WIND (surface wind direction and velocity), CLEARED TO LAND.\nNOTE-\nA clearance to land means that appropriate separation on the landing runway will be ensured. A landing clearance does not relieve the pilot from compliance with any previously issued restriction.\nWhenever a runway length has been temporarily or permanently shortened, state the word “shortened” immediately following the runway number as part of the landing clearance. This information must be issued in conjunction with the landing clearance.\nThe addition of “shortened” must be included in the landing clearance for the duration of the construction project when the runway is temporarily shortened.\nThe addition of “shortened” must be included in the landing clearance until the Chart Supplement is updated to include the change(s) when the runway is permanently shortened.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) SHORTENED, CLEARED TO LAND.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two-Seven shortened, cleared to land.”\nIf landing clearance is temporarily withheld, insert the word “shortened” immediately after the runway number to advise the pilot to continue.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) SHORTENED, CONTINUE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two-Seven shortened, continue.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-12, Airport Construction.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-13, Change in Runway Length Due to Construction.\nANTICIPATING SEPARATION\nLanding clearance to succeeding aircraft in a landing sequence need not be withheld if you observe the positions of the aircraft and determine that prescribed runway separation will exist when the aircraft crosses the landing threshold. Issue traffic information to the succeeding aircraft if a preceding arrival has not been previously reported and when traffic will be departing prior to their arrival.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land, number two following a United Seven-Thirty-Seven two mile final. Traffic will depart prior to your arrival.”\n“American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land. Traffic will depart prior to your arrival.”\nNOTE-\nLanding sequence number is optional at tower facilities where the arrival sequence to the runway is established by the approach control.\nAnticipating separation must not be applied when conducting LUAW operations, except as authorized in subparagraph 3-10-5e2. Issue applicable traffic information when using this provision.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land. Traffic will be a Boeing Seven-Fifty-Seven holding in position.”\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nLANDING CLEARANCE WITHOUT VISUAL OBSERVATION\nWhen an arriving aircraft reports at a position where he/she should be seen but has not been visually observed, advise the aircraft as a part of the landing clearance that it is not in sight and restate the landing runway.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nNOT IN SIGHT, RUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND.\nNOTE-\nAircraft observance on the CTRD satisfies the visually observed requirement.\nWITHHOLDING LANDING CLEARANCE\nDo not withhold a landing clearance indefinitely even though it appears a violation of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations has been committed. The apparent violation might be the result of an emergency situation. In any event, assist the pilot to the extent possible.\nRUNWAY EXITING\nInstruct aircraft where to turn‐off the runway after landing, when appropriate, and advise the aircraft to hold short of a runway or taxiway if required for traffic.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTURN LEFT/RIGHT (taxiway/runway),\nor\nIF ABLE, TURN LEFT/RIGHT (taxiway/runway)\nand if required\nHOLD SHORT OF (runway).\nNOTE-\nRunway exiting or taxi instructions should not normally be issued to an aircraft prior to, or immediately after, touchdown.\nTaxi instructions must be provided to the aircraft by the local controller when:\nCompliance with ATC instructions will be required before the aircraft can change to ground control, or\nThe aircraft will be required to enter an active runway in order to taxi clear of the landing runway.\nEXAMPLE-\n“U.S. Air Ten Forty Two, turn right next taxiway, cross runway two one, contact ground point seven.”\n“U.S. Air Ten Forty Two, turn right on Alfa/next taxiway, cross Bravo, hold short of Charlie, contact ground point seven.”\nNOTE-\nAn aircraft is expected to taxi clear of the runway unless otherwise directed by ATC. Pilots must not exit the landing runway on to an intersecting runway unless authorized by ATC. In the absence of ATC instructions, an aircraft should taxi clear of the landing runway by clearing the hold position marking associated with the landing runway even if that requires the aircraft to protrude into or enter another taxiway/ramp area. This does not authorize an aircraft to cross a subsequent taxiway or ramp after clearing the landing runway.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nThe pilot is responsible for ascertaining when the aircraft is clear of the runway by clearing the runway holding position marking associated with the landing runway.\nGround control and local control must protect a taxiway/runway/ramp intersection if an aircraft is required to enter that intersection to clear the landing runway.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-1-7, Use of Active Runways.\nRequest a read back of runway hold short instructions when not received from the pilot.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Four Ninety-two, turn left at Taxiway Charlie, hold short of Runway 27 Right.”\nor\n“American Four Ninety-two, turn left at Charlie, hold short of Runway 27 Right.”\n“American Four Ninety Two, Roger.”\n“American Four Ninety-two, read back hold instructions.”\nNOTE-\nRead back hold instructions phraseology may be initiated for any point on a movement area when the controller believes the read back is necessary.\nALTITUDE RESTRICTED LOW APPROACH\nA low approach with an altitude restriction of no less than 500 feet above the airport may be authorized except over an aircraft holding in position or a departing aircraft. Do not clear aircraft for restricted altitude low approaches over personnel unless airport authorities have advised these personnel that the approaches will be conducted. Advise the approaching aircraft of the location of applicable ground traffic, personnel, or equipment.\nNOTE-\nThe 500 feet restriction is a minimum. Higher altitudes should be used when warranted. For example, 1,000 feet is more appropriate for super or heavy aircraft operating over unprotected personnel or small aircraft on or near the runway.\nThis authorization includes altitude restricted low approaches over preceding landing or taxiing aircraft. Restricted low approaches are not authorized over aircraft holding in position or departing aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED LOW APPROACH AT OR ABOVE (altitude). TRAFFIC (description and location).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-5, Vehicles/Equipment/Personnel on Runways.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-6, Traffic Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-2-1, Light Signals.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-3, Timely Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-4, Line Up and Wait (LUAW).\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-3, Same Runway Separation.\nCLOSED TRAFFIC\nApprove/disapprove pilot requests to remain in closed traffic for successive operations subject to local traffic conditions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nLEFT/RIGHT (if required) CLOSED TRAFFIC APPROVED. REPORT (position if required),\nor\nUNABLE CLOSED TRAFFIC, (additional information as required).\nNOTE-\nSegregated traffic patterns for helicopters to runways and other areas may be established by letter of agreement or other local operating procedures.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-4, Runway Proximity.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-4, Line Up and Wait (LUAW).\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-3, Same Runway Separation.\nOVERHEAD MANEUVER\nIssue the following to arriving aircraft that will conduct an overhead maneuver:\nPattern altitude and direction of traffic. Omit either or both if standard or when you know the pilot is familiar with a nonstandard procedure.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nPATTERN ALTITUDE (altitude). RIGHT TURNS.\nRequest for report on initial approach.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT INITIAL.\n“Break” information and request for pilot report. Specify the point of “break” only if nonstandard. Request the pilot to report “break” if required for traffic or other reasons.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nBREAK AT (specified point).\nREPORT BREAK.\nOverhead maneuver patterns are developed at airports where aircraft have an operational need to conduct the maneuver. An aircraft conducting an overhead maneuver is VFR and the IFR flight plan is canceled when the aircraft reaches the “initial point” on the initial approach portion of the maneuver. The existence of a standard overhead maneuver pattern does not eliminate the possible requirement for an aircraft to conform to conventional rectangular patterns if an overhead maneuver cannot be approved.\nNOTE-\nAircraft operating to an airport without a functioning control tower must initiate cancellation of the IFR flight plan prior to executing the overhead maneuver or after landing.\nFIG 3-10-14Overhead Maneuver\nEXAMPLE-\n“Air Force Three Six Eight, Runway Six, wind zero seven zero at eight, pattern altitude six thousand, report initial.”\n“Air Force Three Six Eight, break at midfield, report break.”\n“Air Force Three Six Eight, cleared to land.”\n“Alfa Kilo Two Two, Runway Three One, wind three three zero at one four, right turns, report initial.”\n“Alfa Kilo Two Two, report break.”\n“Alfa Kilo Two Two, cleared to land.”\nTimely and positive controller action is required to prevent a conflict when an overhead pattern could extend into the path of a departing or a missed approach aircraft. Local procedures and/or coordination requirements should be set forth in an appropriate letter of agreement, facility directive, base flying manual etc., when the frequency of occurrence warrants.\nSIMULATED FLAMEOUT (SFO) APPROACHES/EMERGENCY LANDING PATTERN (ELP) OPERATIONS/PRACTICE PRECAUTIONARY APPROACHES\nAuthorize military aircraft to make SFO/ELP/practice precautionary approaches if the following conditions are met:\nA letter of agreement or local operating procedure is in effect between the military flying organization and affected ATC facility.\nInclude specific coordination, execution, and approval procedures for the operation.\nThe exchange or issuance of traffic information as agreed to in any interfacility letter of agreement is accomplished.\nInclude a statement in the procedure that clarifies at which points SFOs/ELPs may/may not be terminated. (See FIG 3-10-15 and FIG 3-10-17.)\nTraffic information regarding aircraft in radio communication with or visible to tower controllers which are operating within or adjacent to the flameout maneuvering area is provided to the SFO/ELP aircraft and other concerned aircraft.\nThe high‐key altitude or practice precautionary approach maneuvering altitudes of the aircraft concerned are obtained prior to approving the approach. (See FIG 3-10-15 and FIG 3-10-17.)\nNOTE-\nPractice precautionary/SFO/ELP approaches are authorized only for specific aircraft. Any aircraft, however, might make precautionary approaches, when engine failure is considered possible. The practice precautionary approach maneuvering area/altitudes may not conform to the standard SFO/ELP maneuvering area/altitudes.\nSFO/ELP approaches generally require high descent rates. Visibility ahead and beneath the aircraft is greatly restricted.\nPattern adjustments for aircraft conducting SFOs and ELPs may impact the effectiveness of SFO and ELP training.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-12, Low Approach and Touch‐and‐Go.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Para 7-1-6, Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations.\nFor overhead SFO/ELP approaches:\nRequest a report at the entry point.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT (high or low) KEY (as appropriate).\nRequest a report at low key.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT LOW KEY.\nAt low key, issue low approach clearance or alternate instructions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-8-1, Sequence/Spacing Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-7, Inflight Emergencies Involving Military Fighter‐type Aircraft.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Para 7-1-6, Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations.\nFor straight-in simulation flameout approaches:\nRequest a position report from aircraft conducting straight-in SFO approaches.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT (distance) MILE SIMULATED FLAMEOUT FINAL.\nAt the appropriate position on final (normally no closer than 3 miles), issue low approach clearance or alternate instruction.

Helicopter OperationsTAXI AND GROUND MOVEMENT OPERATION\nWhen necessary for a wheeled helicopter to taxi on the surface, use the phraseology in paragraph 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.\nNOTE-\nGround taxiing uses less fuel than hover‐taxiing and minimizes air turbulence. However, under certain conditions, such as rough, soft, or uneven terrain, it may become necessary to hover/air‐taxi for safety considerations. Helicopters with articulating rotors (usually designs with three or more main rotor blades) are subject to “ground resonance” and may, on rare occasions, suddenly lift off the ground to avoid severe damage or destruction.\nWhen requested or necessary for a helicopter/VTOL aircraft to proceed at a slow speed above the surface, normally below 20 knots and in ground effect, use the following phraseology, supplemented as appropriate with the phraseology in paragraph 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOVER‐TAXI (supplemented, as appropriate, from paragraph 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.)\nCAUTION (dust, blowing snow, loose debris, taxiing light aircraft, personnel, etc.).\nNOTE-\nHover‐taxiing consumes fuel at a high burn rate, and helicopter downwash turbulence (produced in ground effect) increases significantly with larger and heavier helicopters.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - HOVER TAXI.\nAIM, Para 4-3-17, VFR Helicopter Operations at Controlled Airports.\nWhen requested or necessary for a helicopter to proceed expeditiously from one point to another, normally below 100 feet AGL and at airspeeds above 20 knots, use the following phraseology, supplemented as appropriate with the phraseology in paragraph 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nAIR‐TAXI:\nVIA (direct, as requested, or specified route)\nTO (location, heliport, helipad, operating/movement area, active/inactive runway).\nAVOID (aircraft/vehicles/personnel).\nIf required,\nREMAIN AT OR BELOW (altitude).\nCAUTION (wake turbulence or other reasons above).\nLAND AND CONTACT TOWER,\nor\nHOLD FOR (reason- takeoff clearance, release, landing/taxiing aircraft, etc.).\nNOTE-\nAir‐taxi is the preferred method for helicopter movements on airports provided ground operations/conditions permit. Air‐taxi authorizes the pilot to proceed above the surface either via hover‐taxi or flight at speeds more than 20 knots. Unless otherwise requested or instructed, the pilot is expected to remain below 100 feet AGL. The pilot is solely responsible for selecting a safe airspeed for the altitude/operation being conducted.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - AIR TAXI.\nAIM, Para 4-3-17, VFR Helicopter Operations at Controlled Airports.\nWAKE TURBULENCE APPLICATION\nAvoid clearances which require small aircraft or helicopters to taxi in close proximity to taxiing or hover‐taxi helicopters.\nREFERENCE-\nAC 90-23, Aircraft Wake Turbulence, Para 10 and Para 11.\nHELICOPTER TAKEOFF CLEARANCE\nIssue takeoff clearances from movement areas other than active runways or in diverse directions from active runways, with additional instructions as necessary.

(See FIG 3-12-1). If you can determine distances by reference to suitable landmarks, the other aircraft need only be airborne if the following minimum distance exists between aircraft:\nWhen only Category I aircraft are involved- 1,500 feet.\nWhen a Category I aircraft is preceded by a Category II aircraft- 3,000 feet.\nWhen either the succeeding or both are Category II aircraft- 3,000 feet.\nWhen either is a Category III aircraft- 6,000 feet. (See FIG 3-12-2.)\nFIG 3-12-1Sea Lane Departure Operations\nFIG 3-12-2Sea Lane Departure Operations\nA preceding landing aircraft has taxied out of the sea lane.\nNOTE-\nDue to the absence of braking capability, caution should be exercised when instructing a float plane to hold a position as the aircraft will continue to move because of prop generated thrust. Therefore, clearance to line up and wait should be followed by takeoff or other clearance as soon as is practical.\nARRIVAL SEPARATION\nSeparate an arriving aircraft from another aircraft using the same sea lane by ensuring that the arriving aircraft does not cross the landing threshold until one of the following conditions exists:\nThe other aircraft has landed and taxied out of the sea lane. Between sunrise and sunset, if you can determine distances by reference to suitable landmarks and the other aircraft has landed, it need not be clear of the sea lane if the following minimum distance from the landing threshold exists:\nWhen a Category I aircraft is landing behind a Category I or II- 2,000 feet.

DME must be used in lieu of off‐route radials, whenever possible.\nExcept where known signal coverage restrictions exist, an unpublished fix may be used for ATC purposes if its location does not exceed NAVAID altitude and distance limitation, and when off‐route radials are used, the angle of divergence meets the criteria prescribed below.\nNOTE-\nUnpublished fixes should not negate the normal use of published intersections. Frequent routine use of an unpublished fix would justify establishing a fix.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-1-1, Altitude and Distance Limitations.\nDo not hold aircraft at unpublished fixes below the lowest assignable altitude dictated by terrain clearance for the appropriate holding pattern airspace area (template) regardless of the MEA for the route being flown.\nWhen the unpublished fix is located on an off‐route radial and the radial providing course guidance, it must be used consistent with the following divergence angles:\nWhen holding operations are involved with respect to subparagraphs (b) and (c) below, the angle of divergence must be at least 45 degrees.\nWhen both NAVAIDs involved are located within 30 NM of the unpublished fix, the minimum divergence angle is 30 degrees.\nWhen the unpublished fix is located over 30 NM from the NAVAID generating the off‐course radial, the minimum divergence angle must increase 1 degree per NM up to 45 NM; e.g., 45 NM would require 45 degrees.\nWhen the unpublished fix is located beyond 45 NM from the NAVAID generating the off‐course radial, the minimum divergence angle must increase ½ degree per NM; e.g., 130 NM would require 88 degrees.\nFixes contained in the route description of MTRs are considered filed fixes.\nTACAN‐only aircraft (type suffix M, N, or P) possess TACAN with DME, but no VOR or LF navigation system capability. Assign fixes based on TACAN or VORTAC facilities only.\nNOTE-\nTACAN‐only aircraft can never be held overhead the NAVAID, be it TACAN or VORTAC.\nDME fixes must not be established within the no‐course signal zone of the NAVAID from which inbound holding course information would be derived.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-5-3, NAVAID Fixes.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-2, Methods.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

ClearancesCLEARANCE ITEMS\nIssue the following clearance items, as appropriate, in the order listed below:\nAircraft identification.\nClearance limit.\nWhen the clearance limit is an airport, the word “airport” must follow the airport name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT.\nWhen the clearance limit is a NAVAID, and the NAVAID type is known, the type of NAVAID must follow the NAVAID name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (NAVAID name and type).\nWhen the clearance limit is an intersection or waypoint, and the type is known, the type must follow the intersection or waypoint name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (intersection or waypoint name and type).\nStandard Instrument Departure (SID) or vectors, where applicable.\nRoute of flight including ADR/ADAR/AAR when applied.\nAltitude data in the order flown.\nMach number, if applicable.\nUSAF. When issuing a clearance to an airborne aircraft containing an altitude assignment, do not include more than one of the following in the same transmission:\nFrequency change.\nTransponder change.\nHeading.\nAltimeter setting.\nTraffic information containing an altitude.\nHolding instructions.\nAny special information.\nFrequency and beacon code information.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-8, IFR-VFR and VFR-IFR Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-7, Altitude Information.\nCLEARANCE PREFIX\nPrefix a clearance, information, or a request for information which will be relayed to an aircraft through a non-ATC facility by stating “A-T-C clears,” “A-T-C advises,” or “A-T-C requests.”\nFlight service stations and ARTCC Flight Data Units must prefix a clearance with the appropriate phrase: “ATC clears,” “ATC advises,” etc.\nDELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS\nIssue specific clearance delivery instructions, if appropriate.\nCLEARANCE RELAY\nRelay clearances verbatim.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-4-4, Communications Failure.\nROUTE OR ALTITUDE AMENDMENTS\nAmend route of flight in a previously issued clearance by one of the following:\nState which portion of the route is being amended and then state the amendment.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCHANGE (portion of route) TO READ (new portion of route).\nState the amendment to the route and then state that the rest of the route is unchanged.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Amendment to route), REST OF ROUTE UNCHANGED.\nIssue a clearance “direct” to a point on the previously issued route.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED DIRECT (fix, waypoint).\nOr\nCLEARED DIRECT (destination) AIRPORT.\nNOTE-\nClearances authorizing “direct” to a point on a previously issued route do not require the phrase “rest of route unchanged.” However, it must be understood where the previously cleared route is resumed. When necessary, “rest of route unchanged” may be used to clarify routing.\nIssue the entire route by stating the amendment.\nEXAMPLE-\n(Cessna 21A has been cleared to the Airville Airport via V41 Delta VOR V174 Alfa VOR, direct Airville Airport, maintain 9000. After takeoff, the aircraft is rerouted via V41 Frank intersection, V71 Delta VOR, V174 Alfa VOR. The controller issues one of the following as an amended clearance):\n“Cessna Two One Alfa change Victor Forty-One Delta to read Victor Forty-One Frank, Victor Seventy-One Delta.”\n“Cessna Two One Alfa cleared via Victor Forty-One Frank, Victor Seventy-One Delta, rest of route unchanged.”\n“Cessna Two One Alfa cleared via Victor Forty-One Frank, Victor Seventy-One Delta, Victor One Seventy-Four Alfa V-O-R, direct Airville airport, maintain Niner Thousand.”\nWhen route or altitude in a previously issued clearance is amended, restate all applicable altitude restrictions.\nEXAMPLE-\n(A departing aircraft is cleared to cross Ollis intersection at or above 3,000; Gordonsville VOR at or above 12,000; maintain FL 200. Shortly after departure the altitude to be maintained is changed to FL 240. Because altitude restrictions remain in effect, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Amend altitude. Cross Ollis intersection at or above Three Thousand; cross Gordonsville V-O-R at or above One Two Thousand; maintain Flight Level Two Four Zero.”\n(Shortly after departure, altitude restrictions are no longer applicable, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Climb and maintain Flight Level Two Four Zero.”\n(An aircraft is cleared to climb via a SID with published altitude restrictions. Shortly after departure the top altitude is changed to FL 230 and compliance with the altitude restrictions is still required, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Climb via SID except maintain Flight Level Two Three Zero.”\nNOTE-\nRestating previously issued altitude to “maintain” is an amended clearance. If altitude to “maintain” is changed or restated, whether prior to departure or while airborne and previously issued altitude restrictions are omitted, altitude restrictions are canceled, including SID/STAR altitude restrictions if any.\nCrossing altitudes and speed restrictions on Obstacle Departure Procedure/s (ODP/s) cannot be canceled or amended by ATC.\nIssue an amended clearance if a speed restriction is declined because it cannot be complied with concurrently with a previously issued altitude restriction.\nEXAMPLE-\n(An aircraft is cleared to cross Gordonsville VOR at 11,000. Shortly thereafter he/she is cleared to reduce his/her airspeed to 300 knots. The pilot informs the controller he/she is unable to comply with both clearances simultaneously. The controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Cross Gordonsville VOR at One One Thousand. Then, reduce speed to Three Zero Zero.”\nNOTE-\nThe phrase “do the best you can” or comparable phrases are not valid substitutes for an amended clearance with altitude or speed restrictions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-18, Operational Requests.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Section 6, Vectoring, Para 5-6-2, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Section 7, Speed Adjustment, Para 5-7-2, Methods.\nAir traffic control specialists should avoid route and/or altitude changes for aircraft participating in the North American Route Program (NRP) and that are displaying “NRP” in the remarks section of their flight plan.\nNOTE-\nAir traffic control specialists retain the latitude necessary to tactically resolve conflicts. Every effort should be made to ensure the aircraft is returned to the original filed flight plan/altitude as soon as conditions warrant.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-15, North American Route Program (NRP) Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 18, Section 17, North American Route Program.\nTHROUGH CLEARANCES\nYou may clear an aircraft through intermediate stops.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED THROUGH (airport) TO (fix).\nALTRV CLEARANCE\nUse the phrase “via approved altitude reservation flight plan,” if the aircraft will operate in an approved ALTRV.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nVIA APPROVED ALTITUDE RESERVATION (mission name) FLIGHT PLAN.\nNOTE-\nAn ALTRV normally includes the departure, climb, cruise, and arrival phases of flight up to and including holding pattern or point/time at which ATC provides separation between aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-3, Abbreviated Departure Clearance.\nIFR-VFR AND VFR-IFR FLIGHTS\nClear an aircraft planning IFR operations for the initial part of flight and VFR for the latter part to the fix at which the IFR part ends.\nTreat an aircraft planning VFR for the initial part of flight and IFR for the latter part as a VFR departure. Issue a clearance to this aircraft when it requests IFR clearance approaching the fix where it proposes to start IFR operations. The phraseology CLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT AS FILED may be used with abbreviated departure clearance procedures.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-3, Abbreviated Departure Clearance.\nWhen an aircraft changes from VFR to IFR, the controller must assign a beacon code to Mode‐C equipped aircraft that will allow MSAW alarms.\nWhen VFR aircraft operating below the minimum altitude for IFR operations requests an IFR clearance and the pilot informs you, or you are aware, that they are unable to climb in VFR conditions to the minimum IFR altitude:\nBefore issuing a clearance, ask if the pilot is able to maintain terrain and obstruction clearance during a climb to the minimum IFR altitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Aircraft call sign), ARE YOU ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TERRAIN AND OBSTRUCTION CLEARANCE UNTIL REACHING (appropriate MVA/MIA/MEA/OROCA)\nNOTE-\nPilots of pop-up aircraft are responsible for terrain and obstacle clearance until reaching minimum instrument altitude (MIA) or minimum en route altitude (MEA). Pilot compliance with an approved FAA procedure or an ATC instruction transfers that responsibility to the FAA; therefore, do not assign (or imply) specific course guidance that will (or could) be in effect below the MIA or MEA.\nEXAMPLE-\n“November Eight Seven Six, are you able to provide your own terrain and obstruction clearance between your present altitude and six thousand feet?”\nIf the pilot is able to maintain their own terrain and obstruction clearance, issue the appropriate IFR clearance as prescribed in paragraph 4-2-1, Clearance Items, and paragraph 4-5-6, Minimum En Route Altitudes.\nIf the pilot states that they are unable to maintain terrain and obstruction clearance, instruct the pilot to maintain VFR and to state intentions.\nIf appropriate, apply the provisions of paragraph 10-2-7, VFR Aircraft In Weather Difficulty, or paragraph 10-2-9, Radar Assistance Techniques, as necessary.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 4-2-8, IFR-VFR and VFR-IFR Flights (11-03-2014)\nCLEARANCE ITEMS\nThe following guidelines must be utilized to facilitate the processing of airfile aircraft:\nEnsure the aircraft is within your area of jurisdiction unless otherwise coordinated.\nObtain necessary information needed to provide IFR service.\nIssue clearance to destination, short range clearance, or an instruction to the pilot to contact an FSS if the flight plan cannot be processed. If clearance is to destination airport, the phraseology CLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT must be used. If clearance is to a NAVAID, state the name of the NAVAID followed by the type of NAVAID, if the type is known. If clearance is to an intersection or waypoint and the type is known, the type must follow the intersection or waypoint name.\nNOTE-\nThese procedures do not imply that the processing of airfiles has priority over another ATC duty to be performed.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-1, Recording Information.\nCANCELLATION OF IFR FLIGHT PLAN\nIf necessary, before instructing an IFR aircraft arriving at an airport not served by an air traffic control tower or flight service station to change to the common traffic advisory frequency, provide the pilot with instructions on how to cancel his/her IFR flight plan.\nAirports with an air/ground communications station:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign) REPORT CANCELLATION OF IFR ON (frequency).\nAirports without an air/ground communications station:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign) REPORT CANCELLATION OF IFR THIS FREQUENCY OR WITH FLIGHT SERVICE.\nOr\n(Call sign) REPORT CANCELLATION OF IFR THIS FREQUENCY OR WITH (FSS serving the area or the ATC controlling facility).\nEXAMPLE-\n“N13WA report cancellation of IFR this frequency or with McAlester Radio.”\nRespond to a pilot's cancellation of his/her IFR flight plan as follows:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign) IFR CANCELLATION RECEIVED.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Departure ProceduresDEPARTURE TERMINOLOGY\nAvoid using the term “takeoff” except to actually clear an aircraft for takeoff or to cancel a takeoff clearance. Use such terms as “depart,” “departure,” or “fly” in clearances when necessary.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-9, Takeoff Clearance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-11, Cancellation of Takeoff Clearance.\nDEPARTURE CLEARANCES\nInclude the following items in IFR departure clearances:\nNOTE-\nWhen considered necessary, controllers or pilots may initiate read backs of a clearance. Some pilots may be required by company rule to do so.\nAlways include the airport of departure when issuing a departure clearance for relay to an aircraft by an FSS, dispatcher, etc.\nClearance Limit.\nSpecify the destination airport when practicable, even though it is outside controlled airspace. Issue short range clearances as provided for in any procedures established for their use.\nWhen the clearance limit is an airport, the word “airport” must follow the airport name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT\nWhen the clearance limit is a NAVAID and the NAVAID type is known, the type of NAVAID must follow the NAVAID name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (NAVAID name and type)\nWhen the clearance limit is an intersection or waypoint and the type is known, the type must follow the intersection or waypoint name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (intersection or waypoint name and type)\nFor Air Force One (AF1) operations, do not specify the destination airport.\nNOTE-\nPresidential detail is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the destination airport.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDESTINATION AS FILED.\nDeparture Procedures.\nSpecify direction of takeoff/turn or initial heading to be flown after takeoff as follows:\nLocations with Airport Traffic Control Service-Specify direction of takeoff/turn or initial heading as necessary, consistent with published:\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 4-3-2 Departure Procedures (5-24-2011)\nDeparture Procedures (DP). If an aircraft is vectored off a published Standard Instrument Departure (SID) or Obstacle Departure Procedure (ODP), that vector cancels the DP and ATC becomes responsible for separation from terrain and /or obstructions. IFR aircraft must be assigned an altitude.\nDiverse Vector Areas (DVA). The assignment of an initial heading using a DVA can be given to the pilot as part of the initial clearance, but must be given no later than with the takeoff clearance. Once airborne, an aircraft assigned headings within the DVA can be vectored below the MVA/MIA. Controllers cannot interrupt an aircraft's climb in the DVA until the aircraft is at or above the MVA/MIA.\nNOTE-\nIt is important for controllers to understand that there can be differences in published climb gradients applicable to individual departure procedures serving the same airport or runway. Assigning a different departure procedure without the pilot being able to re-brief may result in the pilot rejecting the new procedure.\nWhen a departure clearance includes a SID, concurrent use of a diverse vector area (DVA) is not permitted.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 5-2-7, Departure Control.\nAIM, Para 5-2-9, Instrument Departure Procedures (DP) - Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departures (SID).\nLocations without Airport Traffic Control Service, but within a Class E surface area− specify direction of takeoff/turn or initial heading if necessary. Obtain/solicit the pilot's concurrence concerning a turn or heading before issuing them in a clearance.\nNOTE-\nDirection of takeoff and turn after takeoff can be obtained/solicited directly from the pilot, or relayed by an FSS, dispatcher, etc., as obtained/solicited from the pilot.\nAt all other airports- Do not specify direction of takeoff/turn after takeoff. If necessary to specify an initial heading to be flown after takeoff, issue the initial heading so as to apply only within controlled airspace.\nWhere an ODP has been published for a location and pilot compliance is necessary to ensure separation, include the procedure as part of the ATC clearance. Additionally, when an ODP is included in the clearance and the Visual Climb over Airport (VCOA) is requested by the pilot or assigned by ATC when it is the only procedure published in the ODP, include an instruction to remain within the published visibility of the VCOA.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Depart via the (airport name)(runway number) obstacle departure procedure. Remain within (number of miles) miles of the (airport name) during visual climb” if applicable. Or,\n“Depart via the (graphic ODP name) obstacle departure procedure. Remain within (number of miles) miles of the (airport name) during visual climb” if applicable.\nNOTE-\nPilots will advise ATC of their intent to use the VCOA option when requesting their IFR clearance.\nSome aircraft are required by 14 CFR 91.175 to depart a runway under IFR using the ODP absent other instructions from ATC.\nIFR takeoff minimums and obstacle departure procedures are prescribed for specific airports/runways and published in either a textual, or graphic form with the label (OBSTACLE) in the procedure title, and documented on an appropriate FAA Form 8260. To alert pilots of their existence, instrument approach procedure charts are annotated with a symbol:\nCompatibility with a procedure issued may be verified by asking the pilot if items obtained/ solicited will allow him/her to comply with local traffic pattern, terrain, or obstruction avoidance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nFLY RUNWAY HEADING.\nDEPART (direction or runway).\nTURN LEFT/RIGHT.\nWHEN ENTERING CONTROLLED AIRSPACE (instruction), FLY HEADING (degrees) UNTIL REACHING (altitude, point, or fix) BEFORE PROCEEDING ON COURSE.\nFLY A (degree) BEARING/AZIMUTH FROM/TO (fix) UNTIL (time),\nor\nUNTIL REACHING (fix or altitude),\nand if required,\nBEFORE PROCEEDING ON COURSE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Verify right turn after departure will allow compliance with local traffic pattern,” or “Verify this clearance will allow compliance with terrain or obstruction avoidance.”\nNOTE-\nIf a published IFR departure procedure is not included in an ATC clearance, compliance with such a procedure is the pilot's prerogative.\nSIDs:\nAssign a SID (including transition if necessary). Assign an ADR/ADAR, when applicable or the route filed by the pilot, when a SID is not established for the departure route to be flown, or the pilot has indicated that he/she does not wish to use a SID.\nNOTE-\nDeparture procedure descriptive text contained within parentheses (for example, “Jimmy One (RNAV) Departure”) is not included in departure clearance phraseology.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(SID name and number) DEPARTURE.\n(SID name and number) DEPARTURE, (transition name) TRANSITION.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Stroudsburg One Departure.”\n“Stroudsburg One Departure, Sparta Transition.”\nNOTE-\nIf a pilot does not wish to use a SID issued in an ATC clearance, or any other SID published for that location, he/she is expected to advise ATC.\nIf it is necessary to assign a crossing altitude which differs from the SID altitude emphasize the change to the pilot.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(SID name and number) DEPARTURE, EXCEPT CROSS (revised altitude information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Stroudsburg One Departure, except cross Quaker at five thousand.”\n“Astoria Two Departure, except cross Astor waypoint at six thousand.”\nSpecify altitudes when they are not included in the SID.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(SID name and number) DEPARTURE. CROSS (fix) AT (altitude).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Stroudsburg One Departure. Cross Jersey intersection at four thousand. Cross Range intersection at six thousand.”\n“Engle Two departure. Cross Pilim waypoint at or above five thousand. Cross Engle waypoint at or above seven thousand. Cross Gorge waypoint at niner thousand.”\nRoute of flight. Specify one or more of the following:\nAirway, route, course, heading, azimuth, arc, or vector.\nThe routing a pilot can expect if any part of the route beyond a short range clearance limit differs from that filed.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE VIA (airways, routes, or fixes.)\nAltitude. Use one of the following in the order of preference listed.\nNOTE-\nTurbojet aircraft equipped with afterburner engines may occasionally be expected to use afterburning during their climb to the en route altitude. When so advised by the pilot, the controller may be able to plan his/her traffic to accommodate the high performance climb and allow the pilot to climb to his/her planned altitude without restriction.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLIMB VIA, TOP ALTITUDE\nTo the maximum extent possible, Air Force One will be cleared unrestricted climb to:\n9,000' AGL or higher.\nIf unable 9,000' AGL or higher, then the highest available altitude below 9,000' AGL.\nAssign the altitude requested by the pilot.\nAssign an altitude, as near as possible to the altitude requested by the pilot, and\nInform the pilot when to expect clearance to the requested altitude unless instructions are contained in the specified SID, or\nIf the requested altitude is not expected to be available, inform the pilot what altitude can be expected and when/where to expect it.\nUse one of the following when the SID contains published crossing restrictions:\nInstruct aircraft to “Climb via SID.”\nInstruct the aircraft to “Climb via SID except maintain (altitude)” when a top altitude is not published or when it is necessary to issue an interim altitude.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Johnston Airport, Scott One departure, Jonez transition, Q One Forty-five. Climb via SID.”\n“Cleared to Johnston Airport, Scott One departure, Jonez transition, Q One Forty-five, Climb via SID except maintain flight level one eight zero.”\n“Cleared to Johnston Airport, Scott One departure, Jonez transition, Q One Forty-five, Climb Via SID except maintain flight level one eight zero, expect flight level three five zero one zero minutes after departure.”\nNOTE-\nUse of “Climb via SID Except Maintain” to emphasize a published procedural constraint is an inappropriate use of this phraseology.\nConsidering the principle that the last ATC clearance issued has precedence over the previous, the phraseology “maintain (altitude)” alone cancels previously issued altitude restrictions, including SID/STAR altitude restrictions, unless they are restated or modified.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nAIM, Para 4-4-10, Adherence to Clearance.\nWhen a SID does not contain published crossing restrictions and/or is a SID with a Radar Vector segment or a Radar Vector SID; or a SID is constructed with a Radar Vector segment and contains published crossing restrictions after the vector segment, instruct aircraft to “MAINTAIN (altitude).”\nNOTE-\n14 CFR section 91.185, says that in the event of a two‐way radio communication failure, in VFR conditions or if VFR conditions are encountered after the failure, the pilot must continue the flight under VFR and land as soon as practicable. That section also says that when the failure occurs in IFR conditions the pilot must continue flight at the highest of the following altitudes or flight levels for the route segment being flown:\nThe altitude or flight level assigned in the last ATC clearance received.\nThe minimum altitude (converted, if appropriate, to minimum flight level as prescribed in 14 CFR section 91.121(c)) for IFR operations. (This altitude should be consistent with MEAs, MOCAs, etc.)\nThe altitude or flight level ATC has advised may be expected in a further clearance.\nIf the expected altitude is the highest of the preceding choices, the pilot should begin to climb to that expected altitude at the time or fix specified in the clearance. The choice to climb to the expected altitude is not applicable if the pilot has proceeded beyond the specified fix or if the time designated in the clearance has expired.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB AND MAINTAIN (the altitude as near as possible to the pilot's requested altitude). EXPECT (the requested altitude or an altitude different from the requested altitude) AT (time or fix),\nand if applicable,\n(pilot's requested altitude) IS NOT AVAILABLE.\nEXAMPLE-\nA pilot has requested flight level 350. Flight level 230 is immediately available and flight level 350 will be available at the Appleton zero five zero radial 35 mile fix. The clearance will read:\n“Climb and maintain flight level two three zero. Expect flight level three five zero at Appleton zero five zero radial three five mile fix.”\nA pilot has requested 9,000 feet. An altitude restriction is required because of facility procedures or requirements. Assign the altitude and advise the pilot at what fix/time the pilot may expect the requested altitude. The clearance could read:\n“Climb and maintain five thousand. Expect niner thousand one zero minutes after departure.”\nA pilot has requested 17,000 feet which is unavailable. You plan 15,000 feet to be the pilot's highest altitude prior to descent to the pilot's destination but only 13,000 feet is available until San Jose VOR. Advise the pilot of the expected altitude change and at what fix/time to expect clearance to 15,000 feet. The clearance will read:\n“Climb and maintain one three thousand. Expect one five thousand at San Jose. One seven thousand is not available.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-3, Abbreviated Departure Clearance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-8-2, Initial Heading.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65 Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nAIM, Para 4-4-10, Adherence to Clearance.\nABBREVIATED DEPARTURE CLEARANCE\nIssue an abbreviated departure clearance if its use reduces verbiage and the following conditions are met:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-8, IFR‐VFR and VFR‐IFR Flights.\nThe route of flight filed with ATC has not been changed by the pilot, company, operations officer, input operator, or in the stored flight plan program prior to departure.\nNOTE-\nA pilot will not accept an abbreviated clearance if the route of flight filed with ATC has been changed by him/her or the company or the operations officer before departure. He/she is expected to inform the control facility on initial radio contact if he/she cannot accept the clearance. It is the responsibility of the company or operations officer to inform the pilot when they make a change.\nAll ATC facilities concerned have sufficient route of flight information to exercise their control responsibilities.\nNOTE-\nThe route of flight information to be provided may be covered in letters of agreement.\nWhen the flight will depart IFR, destination airport information is relayed between the facilities concerned prior to departure.\nEXAMPLE-\nA tower or flight service station relay of destination airport information to the center when requesting clearance:\n“Request clearance for United Four Sixty‐One to O'Hare.”\nA center relay to the tower or flight service station when initiating a clearance:\n“Clearance for United Four Sixty‐One to O'Hare.”\nNOTE-\nPilots are expected to furnish the facility concerned with destination airport information on initial radio call‐up. This will provide the information necessary for detecting any destination airport differences on facility relay.\nThe assigned altitude, according to the provisions in paragraph 4-3-2, Departure Clearances, subparagraph e, is stated in the clearance.\nIf it is necessary to modify a filed route of flight in order to achieve computer acceptance due, for example, to incorrect fix or airway identification, the contraction “FRC,” meaning “Full Route Clearance Necessary,” or “FRC/(fix),” will be added to the remarks. “FRC” or “FRC/(fix)” must always be the first item of intra‐center remarks. When “FRC” or “FRC/(fix)” appears on a flight progress strip, the controller issuing the ATC clearance to the aircraft must issue a full route clearance to the specified fix, or, if no fix is specified, for the entire route.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Missoula International Airport, Chief Two Departure to Angley; direct Salina; then as filed; maintain one seven thousand.”\nNOTE-\nChanges, such as those made to conform with traffic flows and preferred routings, are only permitted to be made by the pilot (or his/her operations office) or the controller responsible for initiating the clearance to the aircraft.\nSpecify the destination airport in the clearance.\nWhen no changes are required in the filed route, state the phrase: “Cleared to (destination) airport, ([SID name and number] and SID transition, as appropriate); then, as filed.” If a SID is not assigned, follow with “As filed.” If required, add any additional instructions or information, including requested altitude if different than assigned.\nUse one of the following when the SID contains published crossing restrictions:\nInstruct aircraft to “Climb via SID.”\nInstruct aircraft to “Climb via SID except maintain (altitude)” when a top altitude is not published or when it is necessary to issue an interim altitude.\nNOTE-\nUse of “Climb via SID Except Maintain” to emphasize a published procedural constraint is an inappropriate use of this phraseology.\nInstruct aircraft to MAINTAIN (altitude) when:\nNo SID is assigned.\nA SID does not contain published crossing restrictions and/or is a SID with a Radar Vector segment or is a Radar Vector SID.\nA SID is constructed with a Radar Vector segment and contains published crossing restrictions after the vector segment.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT;\nand as appropriate,\n(SID name and number) DEPARTURE,\nTHEN AS FILED.\nWhen the SID does not contain published crossing restrictions and/or is a SID with a Radar Vector segment or a Radar Vector SID; or is a SID with a radar vector segment and contains published crossing restrictions after the vector segment.\nMAINTAIN (altitude); (additional instructions or\ninformation).\nOr when a SID contains published crossing restrictions,\nCLIMB VIA SID.\nCLIMB VIA SID EXCEPT MAINTAIN (altitude); (additional instructions or information).\nIf a SID is not assigned,\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT AS FILED.\nMAINTAIN (altitude);\nand if required,\n(additional instructions or information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Reynolds Airport; David Two Departure, Kingham Transition; then, as filed.

Expect flight level four one zero, one zero minutes after departure.\n“Cleared to Reynolds Airport as filed. Maintain niner thousand. Expect flight level four one zero, one zero minutes after departure.”\nNOTE-\nSIDs are excluded from “cleared as filed” procedures.\nIf a pilot does not wish to accept an ATC clearance to fly a SID, he/she is expected to advise ATC or state “NO SID” in his/her flight plan remarks.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLIMB VIA, TOP ALTITUDE.\nWhen a filed route will require revisions, the controller responsible for initiating the clearance to the aircraft must either:\nIssue a FRC/FRC until a fix.\nSpecify the assigned altitude to maintain, or Climb Via SID, or Climb Via SID except maintain (altitude), as appropriate.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT.\nOr when the SID does not contain published crossing restrictions and/ or is a SID with a Radar Vector segment or a Radar Vector SID\n(SID name and number) DEPARTURE,\n(transition name) TRANSITION; THEN, AS FILED, EXCEPT CHANGE ROUTE TO READ (amended route portion).

Maintain eight thousand, report leaving four thousand.”\n“Cleared to Reynolds Airport via Victor Ninety‐one Albany, then as filed. Maintain six thousand.”\nIn a nonradar environment specify one, two, or more fixes, as necessary, to identify the initial route of flight.\nSpecify the destination airport, when practicable, followed by the word “airport” even though it is outside controlled airspace.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT\nWhen the clearance limit is a NAVAID, the type of NAVAID must follow the NAVAID name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (NAVAID name and type)\nWhen the clearance limit is an intersection or waypoint and the type is known, the type must follow the intersection or waypoint name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (intersection or waypoint name and type)\nEXAMPLE-\nThe filed route of flight is from Hutchinson V10 Emporia, thence V10N and V77 to St. Joseph. The clearance will read:\n“Cleared to Watson Airport as filed via Emporia, maintain Seven Thousand.”\nDo not apply these procedures when a pilot requests a detailed clearance or to military operations conducted within ALTRV, stereo routes, operations above FL 600, and other military operations requiring special handling.\nNOTE-\nDeparture clearance procedures and phraseology for military operations within approved altitude reservations, military operations above FL 600, and other military operations requiring special handling are contained in separate procedures in this order or in a LOA, as appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-7, ALTRV Clearance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-14, Military Operations Above FL 600.\nDEPARTURE RELEASE, HOLD FOR RELEASE, RELEASE TIMES, DEPARTURE RESTRICTIONS, AND CLEARANCE VOID TIMES\nAssign departure restrictions, clearance void times, or release times to separate departures from other traffic or to restrict or regulate the departure flow. Departures from an airport without an operating control tower must be issued either a departure release, a hold for release, or a release time.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-3-1, Overdue Aircraft.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-4-1, Traffic Restrictions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-4-3, Traffic Resumption.\nDeparture Release.

A release time using a specified number of minutes does not require a time check.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(aircraft identification) RELEASED FOR DEPARTURE AT (time in hours and/or minutes),\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF BY (time), ADVISE (facility) NOT LATER THAN (time) OF INTENTIONS.\nTIME (time in hours, minutes, and nearest quarter minute).\n(aircraft identification) RELEASED FOR DEPARTURE IN (number of minutes) MINUTES\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF IN (number of minutes) MINUTES, ADVISE (facility) OF INTENTIONS WITHIN (number of minutes) MINUTES.\nWhen expect departure clearance times (EDCT) are assigned through traffic management programs, excluding overriding call for release (CFR) operations as described in subparagraph e, the departure terminal must, to the extent possible, plan ground movement of aircraft destined to the affected airport(s) so that flights are sequenced to depart no earlier than 5 minutes before, and no later than 5 minutes after the EDCT.  Do not release aircraft on their assigned EDCT if a ground stop (GS) applicable to that aircraft is in effect, unless approval has been received from the originator of the GS.\nIf an aircraft has begun to taxi or requests taxi in a manner consistent with meeting the EDCT, the aircraft must be released. Additional coordination is not required.\nIf an aircraft requests taxi or clearance for departure inconsistent with meeting the EDCT window, ask the pilot to verify the EDCT.\nIf the pilot's EDCT is the same as the FAA EDCT, the aircraft is released consistent with the EDCT.\nIf the pilot's EDCT is not the same as the FAA EDCT, refer to Trust and Verify note below.\nIf an aircraft requests taxi too late to meet the EDCT, contact the ATCSCC through the appropriate TMU.\nNOTE-\n(Trust & Verify) EDCTs are revised by Air Carriers and Traffic Management for changing conditions en route or at affected airport(s). Terminal controllers' use of aircraft reported EDCT for departure sequencing should be verified with the appropriate TMU prior to departure if this can be accomplished without the aircraft incurring delay beyond the EDCT reported by the aircraft. The preferred method for verification is the Flight Schedule Monitor (FSM). If the EDCT cannot be verified without incurring additional delay, the aircraft should be released based on the pilot reported EDCT. The aircraft operator is responsible for operating in a manner consistent to meet the EDCT.\nCall for Release (CFR). When CFR is in effect, release aircraft so they are airborne within a window that extends from 2 minutes prior and ends 1 minute after the assigned time, unless otherwise coordinated.\nNOTE-\nSubparagraph e applies to all facilities.\nCoordination may be verbal, electronic, or written.\nClearance Void Times.\nWhen issuing clearance void times at airports without an operating control tower, provide alternative instructions requiring the pilots to advise ATC of their intentions no later than 30 minutes after the clearance void time if not airborne.\nThe facility delivering a clearance void time to a pilot must issue a time check. A void time issued using a specified number of minutes does not require a time check.\nNOTE-\nIf the clearance void time expires, it does not cancel the departure clearance or IFR flight plan. It withdraws the pilot's authority to depart IFR until a new departure release/release time has been issued by ATC and acknowledged by the pilot.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARANCE VOID IF NOT OFF BY (clearance void time),\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF BY (clearance void time), ADVISE (facility) NOT LATER THAN (time) OF INTENTIONS.\nTIME (time in hours, minutes, and the nearest quarter minute).\nOr\nCLEARANCE VOID IF NOT OFF IN (number of minutes) MINUTES\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF IN (number of minutes) MINUTES, ADVISE (facility) OF INTENTIONS WITHIN (number of minutes) MINUTES.\nGROUND STOP\nDo not release an aircraft if a ground stop (GS) applicable to that aircraft is in effect, without the approval of the originator of the GS.\nDELAY SEQUENCING\nWhen aircraft elect to take delay on the ground before departure, issue departure clearances to them in the order in which the requests for clearance were originally made if practicable.\nFORWARD DEPARTURE DELAY INFORMATION\nInform approach control facilities and/or towers of anticipated departure delays.\nCOORDINATION WITH RECEIVING FACILITY\nCoordinate with the receiving facility before the departure of an aircraft if the departure point is less than 15 minutes flying time from the transferring facility's boundary unless an automatic transfer of data between automated systems will occur, in which case, the flying time requirement may be reduced to 5 minutes or replaced with a mileage from the boundary parameter when mutually agreeable to both facilities.\nNOTE-\nAgreements requiring additional time are encouraged between facilities that need earlier coordination. However, when agreements establish mandatory radar handoff procedures, coordination needs only be effected in a timely manner prior to transfer of control.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 4, Transfer of Radar Identification, Para 5-4-1, Application.\nThe actual departure time or a subsequent strip posting time must be forwarded to the receiving facility unless assumed departure times are agreed upon and that time is within 3 minutes of the actual departure time.\nVFR RELEASE OF IFR DEPARTURE\nWhen an aircraft which has filed an IFR flight plan requests a VFR departure through a terminal facility, FSS, ARTCC Flight Data Unit, or air/ground communications station:\nAfter obtaining, if necessary, approval from the facility/sector responsible for issuing the IFR clearance, you may authorize an IFR flight planned aircraft to depart VFR. Inform the pilot of the proper frequency and, if appropriate, where or when to contact the facility responsible for issuing the clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nVFR DEPARTURE AUTHORIZED. CONTACT (facility) ON (frequency) AT (location or time if required) FOR CLEARANCE.\nIf the facility/sector responsible for issuing the clearance is unable to issue a clearance, inform the pilot, and suggest that the delay be taken on the ground. If the pilot insists upon taking off VFR and obtaining an IFR clearance in the air, inform the facility/sector holding the flight plan of the pilot's intentions and, if possible, the VFR departure time.\nFORWARDING DEPARTURE TIMES\nTERMINAL\nUnless alternate procedures are prescribed in a letter of agreement or automatic departure messages are being transmitted between automated facilities, forward departure times to the facility from which you received the clearance and also to the terminal departure controller when that position is involved in the departure sequence.\nNOTE-\nLetters of agreement prescribing assumed departure times or mandatory radar handoff procedures are alternatives for providing equivalent procedures.\nThe letters “DM” flashing in the data block signify unsuccessful transmission of a departure message.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

When a lower MEA for subsequent segments of the route is applicable, issue the lower MEA only after the aircraft is over or past the Fix/NAVAID beyond which the lower MEA applies unless a crossing restriction at or above the higher MEA is issued.\nAn aircraft may be cleared below the MEA but not below the MOCA for the route segment being flown if the altitude assigned is at least 300 feet above the floor of controlled airspace and one of the following conditions is met:\nNOTE-\nControllers must be aware that in the event of radio communications or GNSS failure, a pilot will climb to the MEA for the route segment being flown.\nFor aircraft using VOR, VORTAC or TACAN for navigation, this applies only within 22 miles of that NAVAID.\nWhen radar procedures are used, the following actions are taken:\nIn the absence of a published MOCA, assign altitudes at or above the MVA or MIA along the route of flight, and\nLost communications instructions are issued.\nThe aircraft is GNSS equipped.\nAn aircraft may be cleared to operate on jet routes below the MEA (but not below the prescribed minimum altitude for IFR operations) or above the maximum authorized altitude if, in either case, radar service is provided.\nNOTE-\nMinimum en route and maximum authorized altitudes for certain jet route segments have been established above the floor of the jet route structure due to limitations on navigational signal coverage.\nWhere a higher altitude is required because of an MEA, the aircraft must be cleared to begin climb to the higher MEA as follows:\nIf no MCA is specified, prior to or immediately after passing the fix where the higher MEA is designated. (See FIG 4-5-1)\nFIG 4-5-1No MCA Specified\nIf a MCA is specified, prior to the fix so as to cross the fix at or above the MCA. (See FIG 4-5-2)\nFIG 4-5-2MCA Specified\nGNSS MEAs may be approved on published ATS routes. Air traffic may assign GNSS MEAs to GNSS‐equipped aircraft where established.\nNOTE-\nOn high altitude ATS routes, the GNSS MEA is FL180 unless published higher.\nWhere MEAs have not been established, clear an aircraft at or above the minimum altitude for IFR operations prescribed by 14 CFR section 91.177.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-8, IFR‐VFR and VFR‐IFR Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-4-1, Route Use.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 6, Para 5-6-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-7-5, Altitude Assignments.\nALTITUDE INFORMATION\nIssue altitude instructions as follows:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-1, Clearance Items.\nAltitude to maintain or cruise. When issuing cruise in conjunction with an airport clearance limit and an unpublished route will be used, issue an appropriate crossing altitude to ensure terrain clearance until the aircraft reaches a fix, point, or route where the altitude information is available to the pilot. When issuing a cruise clearance to an airport which does not have a published instrument approach, a cruise clearance without a crossing restriction may be issued.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nMAINTAIN/CRUISE (altitude). MAINTAIN (altitude)\nUNTIL (time, fix, waypoint),\nor\n(number of miles or minutes) MILES/MINUTES PAST (fix, waypoint).\nCROSS (fix, point, waypoint),\nor\nINTERCEPT (route) AT OR ABOVE (altitude), CRUISE (altitude).\nNOTE-\nThe crossing altitude must assure IFR obstruction clearance to the point where the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure.\nWhen an aircraft is issued a cruise clearance to an airport which does not have a published instrument approach procedure, it is not possible to satisfy the requirement for a crossing altitude that will ensure terrain clearance until the aircraft reaches a fix, point, or route where altitude information is available to the pilot. Under those conditions, a cruise clearance without a crossing restriction authorizes a pilot to determine the minimum IFR altitude as prescribed in 14 CFR section 91.177 and descend to it at pilot discretion if it is lower than the altitude specified in the cruise clearance.\nInstructions to climb or descend including restrictions, as required. Specify a time restriction reference the UTC clock reading with a time check. If you are relaying through an authorized communications provider, such as New York Radio, San Francisco Radio, FSS, etc., advise the radio operator to issue the current time to the aircraft when the clearance is relayed. The requirement to issue a time check must be disregarded if the clearance is issued via Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC).\nEXCEPTION. If you are in direct, two-way, VHF/UHF voice communication with the pilot and the aircraft is in radar contact, you may specify an elapsed time interval restriction, in full minute increments only, without any reference to the UTC clock. The time restriction begins once the clearance has been acknowledged by the pilot.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, climb to reach one three thousand at two two one five.”\n“Time two two one one and one-quarter.”\nThe pilot is expected to be level at 13,000 feet at 2215 UTC.\nThrough Relay-“Speedbird Five, climb to reach flight level three-five zero at one-two-one-five, time” (Issue a time check).\nIn radar contact and in direct controller to pilot, two-way, VHF/UHF voice communication - “United Four Seventeen, descend to reach flight level three five zero within two minutes.” The time restriction begins once the clearance has been acknowledged by the pilot.\n“United Four Seventeen climb to leave flight level three three zero within two minutes, maintain flight level three five zero.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-2-1, Word Meanings.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-17, Numbers Usage.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB/DESCEND AND MAINTAIN (altitude).\nIf required,\nAFTER PASSING (fix, waypoint),\nor\nAT (time) (time in hours, minutes, and nearest quarter minute).\nCLIMB/DESCEND TO REACH (altitude)\nAT (time (issue time check) or fix, waypoint),\nor\nAT (time).

At any other time it is practicable, authorize climb/descent at pilot's discretion.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB/DESCEND AT PILOT'S DISCRETION.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, descend and maintain six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is expected to commence descent upon receipt of the clearance and to descend at the suggested rates specified in the AIM, paragraph 4-4-10, Adherence to Clearance, until reaching the assigned altitude of 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, descend at pilot's discretion, maintain six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is authorized to conduct descent within the context of the term “at pilot's discretion” as described in the AIM.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen cross Lakeview V-O-R at or above flight level two zero zero, descend and maintain six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is authorized to conduct descent “at pilot's discretion” until reaching Lakeview VOR. The pilot must comply with the clearance provision to cross the Lakeview VOR at or above FL 200, and after passing Lakeview VOR, the pilot is expected to descend at the rates specified in the AIM until reaching the assigned altitude of 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, cross Lakeview V-O-R at and maintain six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is authorized to conduct descent “at pilot's discretion,” but must comply with the clearance provision to cross Lakeview VOR at 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, descend now to flight level two seven zero, cross Lakeview V-O-R at or below one zero thousand, descend and maintain six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is expected to promptly execute and complete descent to FL 270 upon receipt of the clearance. After reaching FL 270, the pilot is authorized to descend “at pilot's discretion” until reaching Lakeview VOR. The pilot must comply with the clearance provision to cross Lakeview VOR at or below 10,000 feet. After Lakeview VOR, the pilot is expected to descend at the rates specified in the AIM until reaching 6,000 feet.\nNOTE-\nA descent clearance which specifies a crossing altitude authorizes descent at pilot's discretion for that portion of the flight to which the crossing altitude restriction applies.\nAny other time that authorization to descend at pilot's discretion is intended, it must be specifically stated by the controller.\nThe pilot may need to know of any future restrictions that might affect the descent, including those that may be issued in another sector, in order to properly plan a descent at pilot's discretion.\nControllers need to be aware that the descent rates in the AIM are only suggested and aircraft will not always descend at those rates.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - PILOT'S DISCRETION.\nWhen a portion of a climb/descent may be authorized at the pilot's discretion, specify the altitude the aircraft must climb/descend to followed by the altitude to maintain at the pilot's discretion.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB/DESCEND NOW TO (altitude), THEN CLIMB/DESCEND AT PILOT'S DISCRETION MAINTAIN (altitude).\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Three Ten, descend now to flight level two eight zero, then descend at pilot's discretion maintain flight level two four zero.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is expected to commence descent upon receipt of the clearance and to descend as prescribed in the AIM, paragraph 4-4-10, Adherence to Clearance, until FL 280. At that point, the pilot is authorized to continue descent to FL 240 within context of the term “at pilot's discretion” as described in the AIM.\nControllers need to be aware that the descent rates are only suggested and aircraft will not always descend at those rates.\nWhen the “pilot's discretion” portion of a climb/descent clearance is being canceled by assigning a new altitude, inform the pilot that the new altitude is an “amended altitude.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Eighty Three, amend altitude, descend and maintain Flight Level two six zero.”\nNOTE-\nAmerican Eighty Three, at FL 280, has been cleared to descend at pilot's discretion to FL 240. Subsequently, the altitude assignment is changed to FL 260. Therefore, pilot's discretion is no longer authorized.\nAltitude assignments involving more than one altitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nMAINTAIN BLOCK (altitude) THROUGH (altitude).\nInstructions to vertically navigate SIDs/STARs with published crossing restrictions (Climb Via/Descend Via).\nWhen established on the SID/STAR.\nWhen navigating a published route inbound to the STAR.\nWhen cleared direct to a waypoint/fix without a published altitude, assign a crossing altitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDESCEND VIA (STAR name and number).\nDESCEND VIA (STAR name and number and runway transition number)\nDESCEND VIA (STAR name and number and runway number).\nCLIMB VIA (SID name and number).\nPROCEED DIRECT (fix/waypoint), CROSS (waypoint/fix) at (altitude) THEN DESCEND VIA (STAR name and number)\nEXAMPLE-\n“Descend via the Eagul Five arrival.\"\n“Descend via the Wynde Eight Arrival, Runway 28 right transition.\"\n“Descend via the Lendy One Arrival, Runway 22 left.\"\n“Climb via the Dawgs Four Departure.\"\n“Proceed direct Denis, cross Denis at or above flight level two zero zero, then descend via the Mmell One arrival.\"\nNOTE-\nPilots must comply with all published speed restrictions on SIDs/STARs, independent of a climb via or descend via clearance.\nClearance to “descent via” authorizes pilots:\nTo descend at pilot discretion to meet published restrictions on a STAR. Pilots navigating on a STAR must maintain the last assigned altitude until receiving clearance to descend via. Once leaving an altitude, the pilot may not return to that altitude without an ATC clearance.\nWhen cleared direct to a waypoint, to descend at pilot discretion to meet restrictions on the procedure. ATC assumes obstacle clearance responsibility for aircraft not yet established or taken off of a procedure.\nTo adjust speeds prior to reaching waypoints with published speed restrictions.\nNOTE-\nWhen cleared for SIDs that contain published speed restrictions, the pilot must comply with those speed restrictions independent of any “climb via” clearance.  Clearance to “climb via” authorizes pilots:\nWhen used in the IFR departure clearance, in a PDC, DCL or when subsequently cleared after departure to a waypoint depicted on a SID, to join a procedure after departure or resume a procedure.\nWhen vertical navigation is interrupted and an altitude is assigned to maintain which is not contained on the published procedure, to climb from that previously-assigned altitude at pilot's discretion to the altitude depicted for the next waypoint. ATC must ensure obstacle clearance until the aircraft is established on the lateral and vertical path of the SID.\nOnce established on the depicted departure, to climb and to meet all published or assigned altitude and speed restrictions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-4-2, Route Structure Transitions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-6, Minimum En Route Altitudes.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-9, Separation From Obstructions.\nP/CG Term - CLIMB VIA, DESCEND VIA.\nNOTE-\nPilots cleared for vertical navigation using the phraseology “descend via” or “climb via” must inform ATC, upon initial contact, of the altitude leaving, the runway transition or landing direction if assigned (STARs), and any assigned restrictions not published on the procedure.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Delta One Twenty One leaving flight level one niner zero, descending via the Eagul Five arrival runway two-six transition.”\n“Delta One Twenty One leaving flight level one niner zero for one two thousand, descending via the Eagul Five arrival, runway two-six transition.”\n“JetBlue six zero two leaving flight level two one zero descending via the Ivane Two arrival landing south.”\n“Cactus Seven Eleven leaving two thousand climbing via the Laura Two departure.”\n“Cactus Seven Eleven leaving two thousand for one-six thousand, climbing via the Laura Two departure.”\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 5-2-8, Instrument Departure Procedures (DP) - Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departures (SID).\nP/CG Term - TOP ALTITUDE, BOTTOM ALTITUDE.AIM, PARA 5-4-1, STANDARD TERMINAL ARRIVAL (STAR) PROCEDURES.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 4-5-7, Altitude Information (12-1-2015)\nA “descend via” clearance must not be used where procedures contain only published “expect” altitude and/or speed restrictions.\nNOTE-\nPilots are not expected to comply with published “expect” restrictions in the event of lost communications, unless ATC has specifically advised the pilot to expect these restrictions as part of a further clearance.\n“Descend via” may be used on procedures that contain both “expect” and required altitude and speed restrictions only if altitude and/or speed restrictions or alternate restrictions are issued for the fix/waypoint associated with all expect restrictions.\n“Descend via” clearances may also be issued if an aircraft is past all fixes/waypoints that have expect restrictions.\nIf it is necessary to assign a crossing altitude which differs from the STAR or SID altitude, emphasize the change to the pilot.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDESCEND VIA (STAR name and number) ARRIVAL, EXCEPT CROSS (fix, point, waypoint), (revised altitude information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“United 454 descend via the Haris One Arrival, except cross Haris at or above one six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe aircraft should track laterally and vertically on the Haris One Arrival and should descend so as to cross Haris at or above 16,000; remainder of the arrival must be flown as published.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB VIA SID, EXCEPT CROSS (fix, point, waypoint), (revised altitude information).\nCLIMB VIA (SID name and number), EXCEPT CROSS (fix, point, waypoint), (revised altitude information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Climb via SID except cross Mkala at or above seven thousand.”\nNOTE-\nIn Example 1, the aircraft will comply with the assigned SID departure lateral path and any published speed and altitude restrictions and climb so as to cross Mkala at or above 7,000; remainder of the departure must be flown as published.\nEXAMPLE-\n(There is a published altitude at Dvine WP): “Proceed direct Dvine, Climb via the Suzan Two departure except cross Mkala at or above seven thousand.”\nNOTE-\nIn Example 2, the aircraft will join the Suzan Two departure at Dvine, at the published altitude, and then comply with the published lateral path and any published speed or altitude restrictions. The aircraft will climb so as to cross Mkala at or above 7,000; remainder of the departure must be flown as published.\nWhen an aircraft has been issued an interim altitude and after departure ATC can subsequently clear the aircraft to climb to the original top altitude published in a SID that contains published crossing restrictions, instruct aircraft to “climb via SID.” When issuing a different altitude and compliance with published restrictions is still required, instruct aircraft to “climb via SID except maintain (altitude).”\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB VIA SID.\nCLIMB VIA SID EXCEPT MAINTAIN (altitude).\nEXAMPLE-\n(An aircraft was issued the Teddd One departure, “climb via SID” in the IFR departure clearance. An interim altitude of 10,000 was issued instead of the published top altitude of FL 230; after departure ATC is able to issue the published top altitude): “Climb via SID.”\nNOTE-\nIn Example 1, the aircraft will track laterally and vertically on the Teddd One departure and initially climb to 10,000; Once re-issued the “climb via” clearance the interim altitude is canceled aircraft will continue climb to FL230 while complying with published restrictions.\nEXAMPLE-\n(Using Example 1, after departure ATC is able to issue an altitude higher than the published top altitude): “Climb via SID except maintain flight level two six zero.”\nNOTE-\nIn Example 2, the aircraft will track laterally and vertically on the Teddd One departure and initially climb to 10,000; once issued “climb via” clearance to FL260 the aircraft will continue climb while complying with published restrictions.\nIf it is necessary to assign an interim altitude or assign a bottom or top altitude not contained on a STAR or SID, the provisions of subparagraph 4-5-7h may be used in conjunction with subparagraph 4-5-7a.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDESCEND VIA THE (STAR name and number) ARRIVAL EXCEPT AFTER (fix) MAINTAIN (revised altitude information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“United 454 descend via the Eagul Five Arrival, except after Geeno maintain one zero thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe aircraft should track laterally and vertically on the Eagul Five Arrival and should descend so as to comply with all speed and altitude restrictions until reaching Geeno and then maintain 10,000. Upon reaching 10,000, aircraft should maintain 10,000 until cleared by ATC to continue to descend.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-1, Clearance Information.\nAIM, Para 5-4-1, Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) Procedures.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB VIA SID EXCEPT AFTER (waypoint name), MAINTAIN (altitude).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Climb via SID except after Baret, maintain flight level one niner zero.”\nNOTE-\nConsidering the principle that the last ATC clearance issued has precedence over the previous, the phraseology “maintain (altitude)” alone cancels previously issued altitude restrictions, including SID/STAR altitude restrictions unless they are restated or modified, and authorizes an unrestricted climb or descent. Speed restrictions remain in effect unless the controller explicitly cancels the speed restrictions.\nRestate “climb/descend via” and then use “except” or “except maintain” phraseology to modify published restrictions or assign a new top/bottom altitude. Use “resume” phraseology with “maintain” to rejoin a route and assign a new altitude where compliance with published altitude restrictions is not required.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-2, Methods.\nAIM, Para 4-4-10 Adherence to Clearance.\nAIM, Para 5-2-8. Instrument Departure Procedures (DP) - Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departures (SID).\nWhen a pilot is unable to accept a clearance, issue revised instructions to ensure positive control and approved separation.\nNOTE-\n14 CFR section 91.123 states that a pilot is not allowed to deviate from an ATC clearance “that has been obtained...unless an amended clearance is obtained” (except when an emergency exists).\nA pilot is therefore expected to advise the controller if a clearance cannot be accepted when the clearance is issued. “We will try” and other such acknowledgements do not constitute pilot acceptance of an ATC clearance.\nControllers are expected to issue ATC clearances which conform with normal aircraft operational capabilities and do not require “last minute” amendments to ensure approved separation.\n“Expedite” is not to be used in lieu of appropriate restrictions to ensure separation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-3, Providing Assistance.\nANTICIPATED ALTITUDE CHANGES\nIf practicable, inform an aircraft when to expect climb or descent clearance or to request altitude change from another facility.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT HIGHER/LOWER IN (number of miles or minutes) MILES/MINUTES,\nor\nAT (fix).

Holding AircraftCLEARANCE TO HOLDING FIX\nConsider operational factors such as length of delay, holding airspace limitations, navigational aids, altitude, meteorological conditions when necessary to clear an aircraft to a fix other than the destination airport. Issue the following:\nClearance limit (if any part of the route beyond a clearance limit differs from the last routing cleared, issue the route the pilot can expect beyond the clearance limit).\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE VIA (routing).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect further clearance via direct Stillwater V-O-R, Victor Two Twenty‐Six Snapy intersection, direct Newark.”\nHolding instructions.\nHolding instructions may be eliminated when you inform the pilot that no delay is expected.\nWhen the assigned procedure or route being flown includes a charted pattern, you may omit all holding instructions except the charted holding direction and the statement “as published.” Always issue complete holding instructions when the pilot requests them.\nNOTE-\nThe most generally used holding patterns are depicted on U.S. Government or commercially produced low/high altitude en route, area, and STAR Charts.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (fix), HOLD (direction), AS PUBLISHED,\nor\nCLEARED TO (fix), NO DELAY EXPECTED.\nEFC. Do not specify this item if no delay is expected.\nWhen additional holding is expected at any other fix in your facility's area, state the fix and your best estimate of the additional delay. When more than one fix is involved, state the total additional en route delay (omit specific fixes).\nNOTE-\nAdditional delay information is not used to determine pilot action in the event of two‐way communications failure. Pilots are expected to predicate their actions solely on the provisions of 14 CFR section 91.185.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (time),\nand if required,\nANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL (time in minutes/hours) MINUTE/HOUR DELAY AT (fix),\nor\nANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL (time in minutes/hours) MINUTE/HOUR EN ROUTE DELAY.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect further clearance one niner two zero, anticipate additional three zero minute delay at Sweet.”\n“Expect further clearance one five one zero, anticipate additional three zero minute en route delay.”\nWhen additional holding is expected in an approach control area, state the total additional terminal delay.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (time),\nand if required,\nANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL (time in minutes/hours) MINUTE/HOUR TERMINAL DELAY.\nTERMINAL. When terminal delays exist or are expected, inform the appropriate center or approach control facility so that the information can be forwarded to arrival aircraft.\nWhen delay is expected, issue items in subparagraphs a and b at least 5 minutes before the aircraft is estimated to reach the clearance limit. If the traffic situation requires holding an aircraft that is less than 5 minutes from the holding fix, issue these items immediately.\nNOTE-\nThe AIM indicates that pilots should start speed reduction when 3 minutes or less from the holding fix. The additional 2 minutes contained in the 5‐minute requirement are necessary to compensate for different pilot/controller ETAS at the holding fix, minor differences in clock times, and provision for sufficient planning and reaction times.\nWhen holding is necessary, the phrase “delay indefinite” should be used when an accurate estimate of the delay time and the reason for the delay cannot immediately be determined; i.e., disabled aircraft on the runway, terminal or center sector saturation, weather below landing minimums, etc. In any event, every attempt should be made to provide the pilot with the best possible estimate of his/her delay time and the reason for the delay. Controllers/supervisors should consult, as appropriate, with personnel (other sectors, weather forecasters, the airport management, other facilities, etc.) who can best provide this information.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDELAY INDEFINITE, (reason if known), EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (time). (After determining the reason for the delay, advise the pilot as soon as possible.)\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Drewe, hold west, as published, expect further clearance via direct Sidney V-O-R one three one five, anticipate additional two zero minute delay at Woody.”\n“Cleared to Aston, hold west on Victor two twenty‐five, seven mile leg, left turns, expect further clearance one niner two zero, anticipate additional one five minute terminal delay.”\n“Cleared to Wayne, no delay expected.”\n“Cleared to Wally, hold north, as published, delay indefinite, snow removal in progress, expect further clearance one one three zero.”\nCLEARANCE BEYOND FIX\nIf no delay is expected, issue a clearance beyond the clearance limit as soon as possible and, whenever possible, at least 5 minutes before the aircraft reaches the fix.\nInclude the following items when issuing clearance beyond a clearance limit:\nClearance limit or approach clearance.\nRoute of flight. Specify one of the following:\nComplete details of the route (airway, route, course, fix(es), azimuth course, heading, arc, or vector.)\nThe phrase “via last routing cleared.” Use this phrase only when the most recently issued routing to the new clearance limit is valid and verbiage will be reduced.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nVIA LAST ROUTING CLEARED.\nAssigned altitude if different from present altitude.\nNOTE-\nExcept in the event of a two‐way communications failure, when a clearance beyond a fix has not been received, pilots are expected to hold as depicted on U.S. Government or commercially produced (meeting FAA requirements) low/high altitude en route and area or STAR charts. If no holding pattern is charted and holding instructions have not been issued, pilots should ask ATC for holding instructions prior to reaching the fix. If a pilot is unable to obtain holding instructions prior to reaching the fix, the pilot is expected to hold in a standard pattern on the course on which the aircraft approached the fix and request further clearance as soon as possible.\nDELAYS\nAdvise your supervisor or flow controller as soon as possible when you delay or expect to delay aircraft.\nWhen arrival delays reach or are anticipated to reach 30 minutes, take the following action:\nEN ROUTE. The center responsible for transferring control to an approach control facility or, for a nonapproach control destination, the center in whose area the aircraft will land must issue total delay information as soon as possible after the aircraft enters the center's area. Whenever possible, the delay information must be issued by the first center controller to communicate with the aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-9, ERAM Computer Entry of Hold Information.\nTERMINAL. When tower en route control service is being provided, the approach control facility whose area contains the destination airport must issue total delay information as soon as possible after the aircraft enters its approach control area. Whenever possible, the delay information must be issued by the first terminal controller to communicate with the aircraft.\nUnless a pilot requests delay information, the actions specified in subparagraphs 1 and 2 above may be omitted when total delay information is available to pilots via ATIS.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Airport) ARRIVAL DELAYS (time in minutes/hours).\nHOLDING INSTRUCTIONS\nWhen issuing holding instructions, specify:\nDirection of holding from the fix/waypoint.\nHolding fix or waypoint.\nNOTE-\nThe holding fix may be omitted if included at the beginning of the transmission as the clearance limit.\nRadial, course, bearing, track, azimuth, airway, or route on which the aircraft is to hold.\nLeg length in miles if DME or RNAV is to be used. Specify leg length in minutes if the pilot requests it or you consider it necessary.\nDirection of holding pattern turns only if left turns are to be made, the pilot requests it, or you consider it necessary.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD (direction) OF (fix/waypoint) ON (specified radial, course, bearing, track, airway, azimuth(s), or route.)\nIf leg length is specified,\n(number of minutes/miles) MINUTE/MILE LEG.\nIf direction of turn is specified,\nLEFT/RIGHT TURNS.\nIssue maximum holding airspeed advisories when an aircraft is:\nApproved to exceed the maximum airspeed of a pattern, and is cleared into a holding pattern that will protect for the greater speed; or\nObserved deviating from the holding pattern airspace area; or\nCleared into an airspeed restricted holding pattern in which the icon has not been published.\nEXAMPLE-\nDue to turbulence, a turboprop requests to exceed the recommended maximum holding airspeed. ATCS may clear the aircraft into a pattern that protects for the airspeed request, and must advise the pilot of the maximum holding airspeed for the holding pattern airspace area.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“MAXIMUM HOLDING AIRSPEED IS TWO ONE ZERO KNOTS.”\nVISUAL HOLDING POINTS\nYou may use as a holding fix a location which the pilot can determine by visual reference to the surface if he/she is familiar with it.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD AT (location) UNTIL (time or other condition.)\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-1-4, Visual Holding of VFR Aircraft.\nHOLDING FLIGHT PATH DEVIATION\nApprove a pilot's request to deviate from the prescribed holding flight path if obstacles and traffic conditions permit.\nUNMONITORED NAVAIDs\nSeparate an aircraft holding at an unmonitored NAVAID from any other aircraft occupying the course which the holding aircraft will follow if it does not receive signals from the NAVAID.\nILS PROTECTION/CRITICAL AREAS\nWhen the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility of 2 miles, do not authorize aircraft to hold below 5,000 feet AGL inbound toward the airport on or within 1 statute mile of the localizer between the ILS OM or the fix used in lieu of the OM and the airport. USAF. The holding restriction applies only when an arriving aircraft is between the ILS OM or the fix used in lieu of the OM and the runway.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Chapter 17, Basic Holding Criteria.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Arrival ProceduresCLEARANCE INFORMATION\nClear an arriving aircraft to a clearance limit by specifying the following:\nName of fix or airport.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT.\nOr\nCLEARED TO (NAVAID name and type if known).\nOr\nCLEARED TO (intersection or waypoint name and type if known).\nRoute of flight including a STAR/RNAV STAR and STAR/RNAV STAR transition, if appropriate. Assign a STAR/RNAV STAR and STAR/RNAV STAR transition to any aircraft in lieu of other routes; e.g., airways or preferential arrival routes when the routings are the same. The clearance must include the name and transition, if necessary, of the STAR/RNAV STAR to be flown.\nTERMINAL: When the STAR/RNAV STAR transition is designed to provide course guidance to multiple runways, the facility must state intended runway number on initial contact, or as soon as practical. If the runway assignment, or any subsequent runway change, is not issued prior to 10 NM from the runway transition waypoint, radar vectors to final must be provided.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(STAR/RNAV STAR name and number) ARRIVAL.\n(STAR/RNAV STAR name and number) ARRIVAL, (transition name) TRANSITION.\nCHANGE/AMEND TRANSITION TO (runway number).\nCHANGE/AMEND TRANSITION TO (runway number) TURN LEFT/RIGHT or HEADING (heading) FOR VECTOR TO FINAL APPROACH COURSE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Rosewood One arrival.”\n“Rosewood One arrival, Delta transition.”\n“Change transition to Runway 09 right.”\n“Amend transition to Runway 22 left, turn right heading 180 for vector to final approach course.”\nNOTE-\nIf a civil pilot does not wish to use a STAR issued in an ATC clearance or any other STAR published for that location, the pilot is expected to advise ATC.\nArrival procedure descriptive text contained within parentheses (for example, “Devine One (RNAV) Arrival”) are not included in arrival clearance phraseology.\nAltitude instructions, as follows:\nAssigned altitude; or\nInstructions to vertically navigate on the STAR or STAR transition.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Bayview Three Arrival, Helen Transition, maintain Flight Level Three Three Zero.”\n“Descend via the Civit One Arrival.”\n“Descend via the Lendy One Arrival, Runway 22 left.”\n“Cross JCT at Flight Level Two Four Zero.”\n“Descend via the Coast Two Arrival.”\n“Civit One Arrival, Descend and Maintain Flight Level Two Four Zero.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-7, Altitude Information.\nAIM, Para 5-4-1, Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) Procedures.\nIssue holding instructions, EFC, and additional delay information as required.\nInstructions regarding further communications as appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-17, Radio Communications.\nADVANCE DESCENT CLEARANCE\nEN ROUTE\nTake the following action when exercising control of aircraft landing at an airport located in an adjacent center's control area near the common boundary:\nCoordinate with the receiving facility for a lower altitude and issue a clearance to the aircraft as appropriate.\nInitiate this action at a distance sufficient from destination to allow for normal descent and speed reduction.\nSINGLE FREQUENCY APPROACHES (SFA)\nTERMINAL\nWhere SFA procedures for military single‐piloted turbojet aircraft on an IFR flight plan are contained in a letter of agreement, do not require a radio frequency change after the aircraft begins approach or after initial contact during an en route descent until a landing or low approach has been completed except under the following conditions:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Para 7-1-5, Single Frequency Approach (SFA).\nP/CG Term - SINGLE‐PILOTED AIRCRAFT.\nDuring daylight hours while the aircraft is in VFR conditions.\nOn pilot request.\nWhen pilot cancels IFR flight plan.\nIn an emergency situation.\nWhen aircraft is cleared for visual approach.\nRADIO FREQUENCY AND RADAR BEACON CHANGES FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT\nWhen military single‐piloted turbojet aircraft will conduct an approach wholly or partly in IFR conditions or at night, take the following action:\nNOTE-\nIt is known that the mental distraction and the inadvertent movement of aircraft controls resulting from the pilot's turning, reaching, or leaning to change frequencies can induce spatial disorientation (vertigo).\nAvoid radio frequency and radar beacon changes to the maximum extent that communications capabilities and traffic will permit. However, when changes are required:\nGive instructions early enough to allow the change before the aircraft reaches the approach fix or handoff point.\nKeep frequency/radar beacon changes to a minimum below 2,500 feet above the surface.\nAvoid requiring frequency/radar beacon changes during the time the aircraft is making a turn.\nWhen traffic volume requires, a frequency other than the one used by aircraft making approaches may be assigned for use in transferring control to the approach control facility.\nTERMINAL\nIf practicable, use a frequency common to both the GCA unit and approach control to minimize frequency changes.\nWhen a GCA unit is not able to communicate on a common frequency, a change to a GCA frequency may be authorized.\nWhen a nonradar approach will be made, aircraft may be instructed to change to tower frequency when:\nThe reported ceiling is at or above 1,500 feet and visibility is 5 statute miles or more.\nThe aircraft reports able to proceed by visual reference to the surface.\nThe aircraft requests and is cleared for a contact approach.\nThe aircraft is cleared for a visual approach.\nAvoid making frequency/radar beacon changes after an aircraft begins a high altitude approach.\nIn the event of a missed approach, do not require a frequency/radar beacon change before the aircraft reaches the missed approach altitude, the MEA, or the MVA.\nMILITARY TURBOJET EN ROUTE DESCENT\nProvide military turbojet aircraft the same arrival procedures that are provided for nonmilitary turbojet aircraft except:\nNOTE-\nIt is the responsibility of the pilot to request a high altitude approach if he/she does not want normal arrival handling.\nAn en route descent may be used in a nonradar environment; however, radar capability should exist which will permit the aircraft to be vectored to the final approach course of a published high altitude instrument approach procedure or PAR/ASR approach. Do not use this procedure if other than normal vectoring delays are anticipated.\nPrior to issuance of a descent clearance below the highest initial approach fix altitude established for any high altitude instrument approach procedure for the destination airport inform the aircraft:\nType of approach to expect.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect V-O-R approach to runway three two.”\nRadar vectors will be provided to the final approach course.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect surveillance/precision approach to runway one seven; radar vectors to final approach course.”\nCurrent weather whenever the ceiling is below 1,000 feet (USAF: 1,500 feet) or the highest circling minimum whichever is greater, or when the visibility is less than 3 miles.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect ILS approach to runway eight; radar vectors to localizer course. Weather (reported weather).”\nIf ATIS is provided and the pilot advises he/she has received the current ATIS broadcast before the descent clearance in subparagraph b is issued, omit those items in subparagraph b that are contained in the broadcast.\nTo avoid requiring an aircraft to fly at low altitudes for an excessive distance, descent clearance should be issued at a point determined by adding 10 to the first two digits of the flight level.\nEXAMPLE-\nFor FL 370, 37 + 10 = 47 miles.\nNOTE-\nTurbojet en route descents are based on a rate of descent of 4,000 to 6,000 feet per minute.\nDo not terminate the en route descent of an aircraft without the consent of the pilot except as required by radar outage or an emergency situation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-4, Altitude Assignment for Military High Altitude Instrument Approaches.\nARRIVAL INFORMATION\nEN ROUTE\nForward the following information to nonapproach control towers soon enough to permit adjustment of the traffic flow or to FSSs (Alaska Only) soon enough to provide local airport advisory where applicable:\nAircraft identification.\nType of aircraft.\nETA.\nType of instrument approach procedure the aircraft will execute; or\nFor SVFR, the direction from which the aircraft will enter Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area and any altitude restrictions that were issued; or\nFor aircraft executing a contact approach the position of the aircraft.\nNOTE-\nSpecific time requirements are usually stated in a letter of agreement.\nForward the following information to approach control facilities before transfer of control jurisdiction:\nNOTE-\nTransfer points are usually specified in a letter of agreement.\nAircraft identification.\nType of aircraft and appropriate aircraft equipment suffix.\nETA or actual time, and proposed or actual altitude over clearance limit. The ETA need not be given if the arrival information is being forwarded during a radar handoff.\nClearance limit (when other than the destination airport) and EFC issued to the aircraft. Clearance limit may be omitted when provided for in a letter of agreement.\nTime, fix, or altitude when control responsibility is transferred to the approach control facility. This information may be omitted when provided for in a letter of agreement.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification), (type of aircraft), ESTIMATED/OVER (clearance limit), (time), (altitude), EFC (time).\nIf required,\nYOUR CONTROL,\nor\nYOUR CONTROL AT (time, fix or altitude).\nWEATHER INFORMATION\nEN ROUTE\nWhen an available official weather report indicates weather conditions are below a 1,000-foot (USAF: 1,500-foot) ceiling or below the highest circling minimum, whichever is higher, or less than three‐miles visibility for the airport concerned, transmit the weather report and changes classified as special weather observations to an arriving aircraft prior to or as part of the approach clearance when:\nIt is transmitted directly to the pilot via center controller‐to‐pilot communications.\nIt is relayed through a communications station other than an air carrier company radio or through a nonapproach control facility. You may do this by telling the station or nonapproach control facility to issue current weather.\nBELOW MINIMA REPORT BY PILOT\nIf an arriving aircraft reports weather conditions are below his/her landing minima:\nNOTE-\nDetermination that existing weather/visibility is adequate for approach/landing is the responsibility of the pilot/aircraft operator.\nIssue appropriate instructions to the aircraft to hold or proceed to another airport.\nAdjust, as necessary, the position in the landing sequence of any other aircraft desiring to make approaches and issue approach clearances accordingly.\nTRANSFER OF JURISDICTION\nTransfer radio communications and control responsibility early enough to allow the receiving facility to clear an aircraft beyond the clearance limit before the aircraft reaches it.\nAPPROACH INFORMATION\nBoth en route and terminal approach control sectors must provide current approach information to aircraft destined to airports for which they provide approach control services. This information must be provided on initial contact or as soon as possible thereafter. Approach information contained in the ATIS broadcast may be omitted if the pilot states the appropriate ATIS code. For pilots destined to an airport without ATIS, items 3-5 below may be omitted after the pilot advises receipt of the automated weather; otherwise, issue approach information by including the following:\nApproach clearance or type approach to be expected if two or more approaches are published and the clearance limit does not indicate which will be used.\nRunway if different from that to which the instrument approach is made.\nSurface wind.\nCeiling and visibility if the reported ceiling at the airport of intended landing is below 1,000 feet or below the highest circling minimum, whichever is greater, or the visibility is less than 3 miles.\nAltimeter setting for the airport of intended landing.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 2, Section 7, Altimeter Settings.\nUpon pilot request, controllers must inform pilots of the frequency where automated weather data may be obtained and, if appropriate, that airport weather is not available.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Airport) AWOS/ASOS WEATHER AVAILABLE ON (frequency).\nASOS/AWOS must be set to provide one minute weather at uncontrolled airports that are without ground‐to‐air weather broadcast capability by a CWO, NWS or FSS observer.\nControllers will consider the long‐line disseminated weather from an automated weather system at an uncontrolled airport as trend information only and must rely on the pilot for the current weather information for that airport.\nControllers must issue the last long‐line disseminated weather to the pilot if the pilot is unable to receive the ASOS/AWOS broadcast.\nNOTE-\nAircraft destined to uncontrolled airports, which have automated weather data with broadcast capability, should monitor the ASOS/AWOS frequency to ascertain the current weather at the airport. The pilot should advise the controller when he/she has received the broadcast weather and state his/her intentions.\nIssue any known changes classified as special weather observations as soon as possible. Special weather observations need not be issued after they are included in the ATIS broadcast and the pilot states the appropriate ATIS code.\nAdvise pilots when the ILS on the runway in use is not operational if that ILS is on the same frequency as an operational ILS serving another runway.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect visual approach runway two five right, runway two five right I-L-S not operational.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-7-2, Altimeter Setting Issuance Below Lowest Usable FL.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-10-2, Approach Information.\n14 CFR Section 91.129, Operations in Class D Airspace, Subpara (d)(2).\nTERMINAL: If multiple runway transitions are depicted on a STAR procedure, advise pilots of the runway assignment on initial contact or as soon as possible thereafter.\nARRIVAL INFORMATION BY APPROACH CONTROL FACILITIES\nTERMINAL\nForward the following information to nonapproach control towers soon enough to permit adjustment of the traffic flow or to FSSs soon enough to provide local airport advisory where applicable:\nAircraft identification.\nType of aircraft.\nETA.\nType of instrument approach procedure the aircraft will execute; or\nFor SVFR, the direction from which the aircraft will enter Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area and any altitude restrictions that were issued; or\nFor aircraft executing a contact approach, the position of the aircraft.\nNOTE-\nSpecific time requirements are usually stated in a letter of agreement.\nForward the following information to the tower when the tower and TRACON are part of the same facility:\nAircraft identification.\nType aircraft if required for separation purposes.\nType of instrument approach procedure and/or runway if differing from that in use.\nNOTE-\nThe local controller has the responsibility to determine whether or not conditions are adequate for the use of STARS data on the CTRD where a facility directive authorizes its use for the transfer of arrival data.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 12-6-4, Use of STARS Quick Look Functions.\nWhere the collocated or satellite tower has STARS data displayed on its CTRD, the STARS modify or quick look functions may be used to forward arrival data provided that a facility directive at the collocated tower or a letter of agreement with the satellite tower exists which outlines procedures for using STARS for transferring this data.\nForward the following information to centers:\nWhere two or more instrument approach procedures are published for the airport, the particular procedure which an aircraft can expect or that it will be vectored toward the airport for a visual approach.\nHighest altitude being used by the approach control facility at the holding fix.\nAverage time interval between successive approaches.\nArrival time of aircraft over the holding fix or, if control has been transferred to you before an aircraft has reached the fix, a statement or other indication acknowledging receipt of control responsibility.\nRevised EFC if different by 10 minutes or more from that issued by the center.\nMissed approaches if they affect center operations.\nInformation relating to an unreported or overdue aircraft.\nAIRPORT CONDITIONS\nEN ROUTE. Before issuing an approach clearance, and subsequently as changes occur, inform an aircraft of any abnormal operation of approach and landing aids and of destination airport conditions that you know of which might restrict an approach or landing. This information may be omitted if it is contained in the ATIS broadcast and the pilot states that he/she has received the appropriate ATIS code.\nNOTE-\nAirport conditions information, in the provision of en route approach control service, does not include the following:\nThe airport surface environment other than the landing area(s) (e.g. TAXIWAY, APRON or SERVICE keyword NOTAMs).\nObstruction information (e.g., OBST NOTAMs) for aircraft that will be cleared for an instrument approach.\nInformation pertaining to cold temperature compensation.\nWhen advised of special use airspace (SUA) or military training route (MTR) activation, appropriate action is taken to separate nonparticipating IFR aircraft from those activities when required, and/or to issue applicable advisories as warranted. When meeting this requirement, there is no requirement for controllers to additionally issue the associated D NOTAM activating that SUA or MTR to the pilot.  Accordingly, D NOTAMs for SUA that contain the accountability codes SUAE, SUAC, and SUAW are not required to be issued.\nAlthough a pilot may have obtained NOTAM information during pre‐flight briefings, airport conditions may have changed in flight. Therefore a pilot stating, or a controller asking, if they “have the NOTAMS” does not relieve the controller of the responsibility of issuing airport conditions that might restrict an approach or landing.

Approach Clearance ProceduresAPPROACH CLEARANCE\nClear aircraft for “standard” or “special” instrument approach procedures only.\nTo authorize a pilot to execute a particular instrument approach procedure:\nSpecify the name of the approach as published on the approach chart.\nWhere more than one procedure is published on a single chart and a specific procedure is to be flown, specify the approach to be flown.\nIf only one instrument approach of a particular type is published, the approach need not be identified by the runway reference.\nAn aircraft conducting an ILS or LDA approach must be advised at the time an approach clearance is issued when the glideslope is reported out of service, unless the title of the published approach procedure allows (for example, ILS or LOC Rwy 05).\nInstrument approach procedures (IAPs) must begin at an initial approach fix (IAF) or an intermediate fix (IF) if there is not an IAF.\nWhere a STAR/ATS route and an IAP connect at an IAF or IF, and the connection will be used, clear the aircraft for approach at least 3 NM prior to the IAF/IF and specify the name of the connection fix. For arrivals via an ATS Route, assign an altitude to maintain until the connection fix.\nNOTE-\nSTARs are not ATS routes.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - AIR TRAFFIC SERVICE (ATS) ROUTES.\nEXAMPLE-\n“At RDFSH, Cleared ILS Runway 27 Approach.”\n“At TNTOE, Cleared RNAV Z Runway 3 Approach.”\n“Cross AMONT at or above 9,000, Cleared ILS Runway 30R Approach.”\nWhere adequate radar coverage exists, radar facilities may vector aircraft to the final approach course in accordance with paragraph 5-9-1, Vectors to Final Approach Course, and paragraph 5-9-2, Final Approach Course Interception.\nWhere adequate radar coverage exists, radar facilities may clear an aircraft to any fix 3 NM or more prior to the FAF, along the final approach course, at an intercept angle not greater than 30 degrees.\nControllers must not disapprove a pilot request to cold temperature compensate in conjunction with the issuance of an approach clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED (type) APPROACH.\nCLEARED APPROACH.\n(To authorize a pilot to execute his/her choice of instrument approach),\nCLEARED (specific procedure to be flown) APPROACH.\n(Where more than one procedure is published on a single chart and a specific procedure is to be flown),\nAt (fix), CLEARED (specific procedure to be flown) APPROACH.\n(To issue an approach clearance when a STAR/ATS route and IAP are directly connected),\nCLEARED (ILS/LDA) APPROACH, GLIDESLOPE UNUSABLE.\n(To authorize a pilot to execute an ILS or an LDA approach when the glideslope is out of service)\nCLEARED LOCALIZER APPROACH\n(When the title of the approach procedure contains “or LOC”)\nCANCEL APPROACH CLEARANCE (additional instructions as necessary)\n(When it is necessary to cancel a previously issued approach clearance)\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared Approach.”\n“Cleared (V-O-R/I-L-S/Localizer) Approach.”\n“Cleared L-D-A Runway Three‐Six Approach.”\n“Cleared Localizer Back Course Runway One‐Three Approach.”\n“Cleared RNAV Z Runway Two‐Two Approach.”\n“Cleared BRANCH ONE Arrival and (ILS/RNAV) Runway One‐Three Approach.”\n“Cleared I-L-S Runway Three‐Six Approach, glideslope unusable.”\n“Cleared G-L-S Approach.”\nNOTE-\nClearances authorizing instrument approaches are issued on the basis that, if visual contact with the ground is made before the approach is completed, the entire approach procedure will be followed unless the pilot receives approval for a contact approach, is cleared for a visual approach, or cancels their IFR flight plan.\nApproach clearances are issued based on known traffic. The receipt of an approach clearance does not relieve the pilot of his/her responsibility to comply with applicable Parts of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the notations on instrument approach charts which levy on the pilot the responsibility to comply with or act on an instruction; for example, “Straight-in minima not authorized at night,” “Procedure not authorized when glideslope/glidepath not used,” “Use of procedure limited to aircraft authorized to use airport,” or “Procedure not authorized at night” or Snowflake icon with associated temperature.\nIn some cases, the name of the approach, as published, is used to identify the approach, even though a component of the approach aid, other than the localizer on an ILS is inoperative.\nWhere more than one procedure to the same runway is published on a single chart, each must adhere to all final approach guidance contained on that chart, even though each procedure will be treated as a separate entity when authorized by ATC.\nThe use of alphabetical identifiers in the approach name with a letter from the end of the alphabet; for example, X, Y, Z, such as “HI TACAN Z Rwy 6L or RNAV(GPS) Y Rwy 04”, denotes multiple straight-in approaches to the same runway that use the same approach aid.\nAlphabetical suffixes with a letter from the beginning of the alphabet; for example, A, B, C, denote a procedure that does not meet the criteria for straight-in landing minimums authorization.\n14 CFR section 91.175(j) requires a pilot to receive a clearance to conduct a procedure turn when vectored to a final approach course or fix, conducting a timed approach, or when the procedure specifies “NO PT.”\nAn aircraft which has been cleared to a holding fix and prior to reaching that fix is issued a clearance for an approach, but not issued a revised routing; that is, “proceed direct to....” may be expected to proceed via the last assigned route, a feeder route (if one is published on the approach chart), and then to commence the approach as published. If, by following the route of flight to the holding fix, the aircraft would overfly an IAF or the fix associated\\ with the beginning of a feeder route to be used, the aircraft is expected to commence the approach using the published feeder route to the IAF or from the IAF as appropriate; that is, the aircraft would not be expected to overfly and return to the IAF or feeder route.\nApproach name items contained within parenthesis; for example, RNAV (GPS) Rwy 04, are not included in approach clearance phraseology.\nPilots are required to advise ATC when intending to apply cold temperature compensation to instrument approach segments. Pilots must advise ATC of the amount of compensation required for each affected segment on initial contact or as soon as possible. Pilots are not required to advise ATC when correcting on the final segment only. Controllers may delay the issuance of an approach clearance to comply with approved separation requirements when informed that a pilot will apply cold temperature compensation (CTC). Pilots will not apply altitude compensation, unless authorized, when assigned an altitude prior to an approach clearance. Consideration should be given to vectoring aircraft at or above the requested compensating altitude if possible. This eliminates pilots having to climb once on the approach.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS).\nP/CG Term - COLD TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION.\nAIM, Para 5-1-17, Cold Temperature Operations.\nAIM, Para 5-5-4, Instrument Approach.\nThere are some systems, for example, Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS), which allow pilots to conduct Instrument Approach Procedures (IAP) when the reported weather is below minimums prescribed on the IAP to be flown.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR § 91.175(l).\nP/CG Term - EFVS.\nFor aircraft operating on unpublished routes, issue the approach clearance only after the aircraft is:\nEstablished on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure, or (See FIG 4-8-1)\nEXAMPLE-\nThe aircraft is established on a segment of a published route at 5,000 feet. “Cleared V‐O‐R Runway Three Four Approach.”\nFIG 4-8-1Approach Clearance Example\nAssigned an altitude to maintain until the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure. (See FIG 4-8-2.)\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 1 is cleared direct LEFTT. The MVA in the area is 3,000 feet, and the aircraft is at 4,000 feet. “Cross LEFTT at or above three thousand five hundred, cleared RNAV Runway One Eight Approach.”\nThe MVA in the area is 3,000 feet and Aircraft 2 is at 3,000 feet. “Cleared direct LEFTT direct CENTR, maintain three thousand until CENTR, cleared straight-in RNAV Runway One Eight Approach.”\nFIG 4-8-2Approach Clearance Example\nNOTE-\nThe altitude assigned must assure IFR obstruction clearance from the point at which the approach clearance is issued until established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure.\nIf the altitude assignment is VFR‐on‐top, it is conceivable that the pilot may elect to remain high until arrival over the final approach fix which may require the pilot to circle to descend so as to cross the final approach fix at an altitude that would permit landing.\nAn aircraft is not established on an approach until at or above an altitude published on that segment of the approach.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8260.3 United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Para 11-3.\nExcept for visual approaches, do not clear an aircraft direct to the FAF unless it is also an IAF, wherein the aircraft is expected to execute the depicted procedure turn or hold-in-lieu of procedure turn.\nIntercept angles greater than 90 degrees may be used when a procedure turn, a hold-in-lieu of procedure turn pattern, or arrival holding is depicted and the pilot will execute the procedure.\nIf a procedure turn, hold-in-lieu of procedure turn, or arrival holding pattern is depicted and the angle of intercept is 90 degrees or less, the aircraft must be instructed to conduct a straight-in approach if ATC does not want the pilot to execute a procedure turn or hold-in-lieu of procedure turn. (See FIG 4-8-3.)\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED STRAIGHT-IN (type) APPROACH\nNOTE-\nRestate “cleared straight-in” in the approach clearance even if the pilot was advised earlier to expect a straight-in approach.\nSome approach charts have an arrival holding pattern depicted at the IAF using a “thin line” holding symbol. It is charted where holding is frequently required prior to starting the approach procedure so that detailed holding instructions are not required. The arrival holding pattern is not authorized unless assigned by ATC.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared direct SECND, maintain at or above three thousand until SECND, cleared straight-in ILS Runway One-Eight approach.”\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 5-4-5, Instrument Approach Procedure Charts.\nAIM, Para 5-4-9, Procedure Turn and Hold-in-lieu of Procedure Turn.\nFIG 4-8-3Approach Clearance Example\nFor Aircraft On a Conventional Approach\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 1 can be cleared direct to XYZ VORTAC, or SECND because the intercept angle is 90 degrees or less.\nAircraft 2 cannot be cleared to XYZ VORTAC because the intercept angle is greater than 90 degrees.\nAircraft 2 can be cleared to SECND if allowed to execute the hold-in-lieu of procedure turn pattern.\nExcept when applying radar procedures, timed or visual approaches, clear an aircraft for an approach to an airport when the preceding aircraft has landed or canceled IFR flight plan.\nWhere instrument approaches require radar monitoring and radar services are not available, do not use the phraseology “cleared approach,” which allows the pilot his/her choice of instrument approaches.\nRNAV APPLICATION\nFor RNAV-equipped aircraft operating on unpublished routes, issue approach clearance for conventional or RNAV SIAP including approaches with RF legs only after the aircraft is: (See FIG 4-8-4).\nEstablished on a heading or course direct to the IAF at an intercept angle not greater than 90 degrees and is assigned an altitude in accordance with b2. Radar monitoring is required to the IAF for RNAV (RNP) approaches when no hold-in-lieu of procedure turn is executed.\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 1 can be cleared direct to CENTR. The intercept angle at that IAF is 90 degrees or less. The minimum altitude for IFR operations (14 CFR, section 91.177) along the flight path to the IAF is 3,000 feet. If a hold in lieu of procedure turn pattern is depicted at an IAF and a TAA is not defined, the aircraft must be instructed to conduct a straight-in approach if ATC does not want the pilot to execute a hold-in-lieu procedure turn. “Cleared direct CENTR, maintain at or above three thousand until CENTR, cleared straight-in RNAV Runway One-Eight Approach.”\nEstablished on a heading or course direct to the IF at an angle not greater than 90 degrees, provided the following conditions are met:\nAssign an altitude in accordance with b2 that will permit a normal descent to the FAF.\nNOTE-\nControllers should expect aircraft to descend at approximately 150-300 feet per nautical mile when applying guidance in subparagraph h2(a).\nRadar monitoring is provided to the IF.\nThe SIAP must identify the intermediate fix with the letters “IF.”\nFor procedures where an IAF is published, the pilot is advised to expect clearance to the IF at least 5 miles from the fix.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect direct CENTR for RNAV Runway One-Eight Approach.”\nEstablished on a heading or course direct to a fix between the IF and FAF, at an intercept angle not greater than 30 degrees, and assigned an altitude in accordance with b2.\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 1 is more than 5 miles from SHANN. The minimum altitude for IFR operations (14 CFR section 91.177) along the flight path to SHANN is 3,000 feet. SHANN is a step down fix between the IF/IAF (CENTR) and the FAF. To clear Aircraft 1 to SHANN, ATC must ensure the intercept angle for the intermediate segment at SHANN is not greater than 30 degrees and must be cleared to an altitude that will allow a normal descent to the FAF. “Cleared direct SHANN, cross SHANN at or above three thousand, cleared RNAV Runway One-Eight Approach.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-2, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 9, Radar Arrivals.\nFIG 4-8-4Approach Clearance Example\nFor RNAV Aircraft\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 2 cannot be cleared direct to CENTR unless the aircraft is allowed to execute the hold-in-lieu of procedure turn. The intercept angle at that IF/IAF is greater than 90 degrees. The minimum altitude for IFR operations (14 CFR section 91.177) along the flight path to the IAF is 3,000 feet. “Cleared direct CENTR, maintain at or above three thousand until CENTR, cleared RNAV Runway One-Eight approach.” The pilot is expected to proceed direct CENTR and execute the hold-in-lieu of procedure turn.\nAircraft 2 can be cleared direct LEFTT. The intercept angle at that IAF is 90 degrees or less. The minimum altitude for IFR operations (14 CFR section 91.177) along the flight path to the IAF is 3,000 feet. “Cleared direct LEFTT, maintain at or above three thousand until LEFTT, cleared RNAV Runway One-Eight Approach.” The pilot does not have to be cleared for a straight-in approach since no hold-in-lieu of procedure turn pattern is depicted at LEFTT.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 9, Radar Arrivals.\nClear RNAV-equipped aircraft conducting RNAV instrument approach procedures that contain radius to fix (RF) legs:\nVia published transitions, or\nIn accordance with subparagraph h.\nDo not clear aircraft direct to any waypoint beginning or within an RF leg.\nDo not assign fix/waypoint crossing speeds in excess of charted speed restrictions.\nNOTE-\nRNAV approaches (containing RF legs) that commence at 10,000 feet or above require special procedures that will be site specific and specified in a facility directive.\nAn RF leg is defined as a curved segment indicating a constant radius circular path about a defined turn center that begins at a waypoint. RF legs may have maximum airspeeds charted for procedural containment that must be followed.\nIf an aircraft is vectored off the procedure, expect the aircraft to request a return to an IAF.\nFIG 4-8-5Radius to Fix (RF) and Track to Fix (TF)\nNOTE-\nThe segment between THIRD and FORTH in FIG 4-8-5 is an RF leg.\nThe straight segments between waypoints in FIG 4-8-5 are TF legs.\nWhere a terminal arrival area (TAA) has been established to support instrument approaches, use the procedures under subparagraph b above. (See FIG 4-8-6 and FIG 4-8-7.)\nNOTE-\nAircraft that are within the lateral boundary of a TAA, and at or above the TAA minimum altitude, are established on the approach and may be issued an approach clearance without an altitude restriction.\nThe TAA minimum altitude may be higher than the MVA/MIA. If an aircraft is below the TAA minimum altitude, it must either be assigned an altitude to maintain until established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure, or climbed to the TAA altitude.\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 1: The aircraft is at or above the minimum TAA altitude and within the lateral boundary of the TAA. “Cleared R-NAV Runway One Eight Approach.\"\nAircraft 2: The MVA is 3000 feet and the aircraft is level at 4000 feet. The TAA minimum altitude is 4200 feet. The aircraft must be assigned an altitude to maintain until established on a segment of the approach. “Cross RIGHT at or above three thousand, cleared R-NAV Runway One Eight Approach.\"\nAircraft 3: The aircraft is inbound to the CHARR IAF on an unpublished direct route at 7,000 feet. The minimum IFR altitude for IFR operations (14 CFR section 91.177) along this flight path to the IAF is 5,000 feet. “Cleared direct CHARR, maintain at or above five thousand until entering the TAA, cleared RNAV Runway One‐Eight Approach.\"\nFIG 4-8-6Basic “T\" and TAA Design\nFIG 4-8-7Basic \"T\" and TAA Design with ILS\nWhen GPS TESTING NOTAMs are published and testing is actually occurring, inform pilots requesting or cleared for a RNAV approach that GPS may not be available and request intentions. Do not resume RNAV approach operations until certain that GPS interference is no longer a factor or such GPS testing exercise has ceased.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 4-8-1, Approach Clearance (ZAB) (7-17-2015)\n7110.65, 4-8-1, Approach Clearance (ZKC) (7-17-2015)\nDuring times when pilots report GPS anomalies, request the pilot's intentions and/or clear that aircraft for an alternative approach, if available and operational. Announce to other aircraft requesting an RNAV approach that GPS is reported unavailable and request intentions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-10, NAVAID Malfunctions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nWhen clearing an aircraft for an RNAV approach, and a GPS NOTAM is published (a WAAS NOTAM is not issued), both GPS and WAAS may become unavailable. Therefore, when a GPS anomaly is reported, request the pilot's intentions.\nNOTE-\nWAAS UNAVAILABLE NOTAMs are published to indicate a failure of a WAAS system component. Airborne GPS/WAAS equipment may revert to GPS‐only operation which satisfies the requirements for basic RNAV (GPS) approaches to the airport of intended landing or filed alternate airport, if airborne equipment is approved for such operations.\nAPPROACH CLEARANCE TO UNCONTROLLED AIRPORTS\nWhen issuing an approach clearance at locations without an operating control tower or where part‐time towers are closed, state the name of the airport.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED (type) APPROACH TO (airport name)\nor\nCLEARED APPROACH TO (airport name)\n(To authorize a pilot to execute his/her choice of instrument approach)\nRELAYED APPROACH CLEARANCE\nTERMINAL\nInclude the weather report, when it is required and available, when an approach clearance is relayed through a communication station other than an air carrier company radio. You may do this by telling the station to issue current weather.\nALTITUDE ASSIGNMENT FOR MILITARY HIGH ALTITUDE INSTRUMENT APPROACHES\nAltitudes above those shown on the high altitude instrument approach procedures chart may be specified when required for separation.\nNOTE-\nTo preclude the possibility of aircraft exceeding rate‐of‐descent or airspeed limitations, the maximum altitudes which may be assigned for any portion of the high altitude instrument approach procedure will be determined through coordination between the ATC facility concerned and the military authority which originated the high altitude instrument approach procedure.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-5, Military Turbojet En Route Descent.\nSPECIFYING ALTITUDE\nSpecify in the approach clearance the altitude shown in the approach procedures when adherence to that altitude is required for separation. When vertical separation will be provided from other aircraft by pilot adherence to the prescribed maximum, minimum, or mandatory altitudes, the controller may omit specifying the altitude in the approach clearance.\nNOTE-\nUse FAA or NGA instrument approach procedures charts appropriate for the aircraft executing the approach.\nCIRCLING APPROACH\nCircling approach instructions may only be given for aircraft landing at airports with operational control towers.\nInclude in the approach clearance instructions to circle to the runway in use if landing will be made on a runway other than that aligned with the direction of instrument approach. When the direction of the circling maneuver in relation to the airport/runway is required, state the direction (eight cardinal compass points) and specify a left or right base/downwind leg as appropriate.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCIRCLE TO RUNWAY (number),\nor\nCIRCLE (direction using eight cardinal compass points) OF THE AIRPORT/RUNWAY FOR A LEFT/RIGHT BASE/DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY (number).\nNOTE-\nWhere standard instrument approach procedures (SIAPs) authorize circling approaches, they provide a basic minimum of 300 feet of obstacle clearance at the MDA within the circling area considered. The dimensions of these areas, expressed in distances from the runways, vary for the different approach categories of aircraft. In some cases a SIAP may otherwise restrict circling approach maneuvers.\nDo not issue clearances, such as “extend downwind leg,” which might cause an aircraft to exceed the circling approach area distance from the runways within which required circling approach obstacle clearance is assured.\nSIDE-STEP MANEUVER\nTERMINAL\nSide‐step Maneuver. When authorized by an instrument approach procedure, you may clear an aircraft for an approach to one runway and inform the aircraft that landing will be made on a parallel runway.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared I-L-S Runway seven left approach. Side‐step to runway seven right.”\nNOTE-\nSide‐step maneuvers require higher weather minima/MDA. These higher minima/MDA are published on the instrument approach charts.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-2, Closed/Unsafe Runway Information.\nP/CG Term - SIDE-STEP MANEUVER.\nCOMMUNICATIONS RELEASE\nIf an IFR aircraft intends to land at an airport not served by a tower or FSS, approve a change to the advisory service frequency when you no longer require direct communications.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCHANGE TO ADVISORY FREQUENCY APPROVED.\nNOTE-\nAn expeditious frequency change permits the aircraft to receive timely local airport traffic information in accordance with AC 90-66, Non‐Towered Airport Flight Operations.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 4-8-8, Communication Release and Applicability to Special VFR Aircraft (9-24-2014)\nMISSED APPROACH\nExcept in the case of a VFR aircraft practicing an instrument approach, an approach clearance automatically authorizes the aircraft to execute the missed approach procedure depicted for the IAP being flown.\nIf assignment of the alternate missed approach procedure is necessary, the controller must issue the description as published on the appropriate FAA Form 8260 or military form for the IAP.\nIf the alternate missed approach procedure is published and in effect via NOTAM, the procedure description need not be issued to the pilot.\nAfter an aircraft commences a missed approach, it may be vectored at or above the MVA/MIA or follow the provisions of paragraph 5-6-3, Vectors Below Minimum Altitude.\nNOTE-\nIn the event of a missed approach involving a turn, unless otherwise cleared, the pilot will proceed to the missed approach point before starting that turn.\nPilots must advise ATC when intending to apply cold temperature compensation and of the amount of compensation required. Pilots will not apply altitude compensation, unless authorized, when assigned an altitude if provided an initial heading to fly or radar vectors in lieu of published missed approach procedures. Consideration should be given to vectoring aircraft at or above the requested compensating altitude if possible.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-11, Practice Instrument Approaches.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-3, Vectors Below Minimum Altitude.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-8-3, Successive or Simultaneous Departures.\nFAA Order 8260.19, Flight Procedures and Airspace.\nFAA Order 8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Para 2-8-1 and Chapter 16.\nAIM, Para 5-4-21, Missed Approach.\nAIM, Para 5-5-5, Missed Approach.\nAPPROACH INFORMATION\nSpecify the following in the approach clearance when the pilot says he/she is unfamiliar with the procedure:\nInitial approach altitude.\nDirection and distance from the holding fix within which procedure turn is to be completed.\nAltitude at which the procedure turn is to be made.\nFinal approach course and altitude.\nMissed approach procedures if considered necessary.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nINITIAL APPROACH AT (altitude), PROCEDURE TURN AT (altitude), (number) MINUTES/MILES (direction), FINAL APPROACH ON (name of NAVAID) (specified) COURSE/RADIAL/AZIMUTH AT (altitude).\nApplicable notations on instrument approach charts which levy on the pilot the responsibility to comply with or act on an instruction; for example, “Straight-in minima not authorized at night,” “Procedure not authorized when glideslope/glidepath not used,” “Use of procedure limited to aircraft authorized to use airport,” “Procedure not authorized at night,” or a Snowflake icon indicating mandatory cold temperature compensation.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 5-1-17, Cold Temperature Operations.\nAIM, Para 5-5-4, Instrument Approach.\nAIM, Para 5-5-5, Missed Approach.\nPRACTICE INSTRUMENT APPROACHES\nAuthorize, withdraw authorization, delay, or refuse to authorize practice instrument approaches in accordance with the following:\nWhen sector/position traffic conditions and/or workload prevent the authorization of practice instrument approaches, advise the pilot of the reason, and if applicable, the anticipated delay until the operation can be approved. Controller‐imposed delays should not be indefinite. Normally, approaches in progress should not be terminated.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 6-4-4, Practice Instrument Approaches.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-4-5, Practice Instrument Approaches.\nExcept for military aircraft operating at military airfields, ensure that neither VFR nor IFR practice approaches disrupt the flow of other arriving and departing IFR or VFR aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThe priority afforded other aircraft over practice instrument approaches is not intended to be so rigidly applied that it causes grossly inefficient application of services.\nIFR aircraft conducting practice instrument approaches must be afforded IFR separation in accordance with Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 of this order until the aircraft lands and the flight is terminated, or the pilot cancels the flight plan.\nVFR aircraft conducting practice instrument approaches:\nMust be instructed to maintain VFR on initial contact or as soon as possible thereafter.\nNOTE-\nThis advisory is intended to remind the pilot that even though ATC is providing IFR‐type instructions, the pilot is responsible for compliance with the CFRs governing VFR flight.\nWhere a facility directive requires the application of IFR separation to VFR aircraft practicing instrument approaches, IFR separation in accordance with Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 of this order must be provided. Except for super or heavy aircraft, 500 feet vertical separation may be applied between VFR aircraft and between a VFR and an IFR aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 6-4-4, Practice Instrument Approaches.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-4-5, Practice Instrument Approaches.\nController responsibility for IFR separation to VFR aircraft begins at the point where the approach clearance becomes effective and ends when the aircraft reaches the missed approach point, unless IFR separation is required for the missed approach procedure as specified in subparagraph e2 below.\nWhere a facility directive does not require the application of IFR separation services to VFR aircraft practicing instrument approaches, the controller must:\nInstruct the pilot to maintain VFR and advise the pilot that separation services are not provided.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“(Aircraft identification) MAINTAIN VFR, PRACTICE APPROACH APPROVED, NO SEPARATION SERVICES PROVIDED.”\nProvide traffic information or advise the pilot to contact the appropriate facility.\nIf an altitude is assigned, including at or above/below altitudes, the altitude specified must meet MVA, minimum safe altitude, or minimum IFR altitude criteria.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-7-5, Altitude Assignments.\nMissed Approaches.\nUnless alternate instructions have been issued, IFR aircraft are automatically authorized to execute the missed approach depicted for the instrument approach being flown.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-9, Missed Approach.\nVFR aircraft are not automatically authorized to execute the missed approach procedure. This authorization must be specifically requested by the pilot and approved by the controller. When a missed approach has been approved and the practice approach is conducted in accordance with subparagraph d2 above, IFR separation must be provided throughout the procedure including the missed approach. If the practice approach is conducted in accordance with subparagraph d3 above, IFR separation services are not required during the missed approach.\nLOW APPROACH AND TOUCH‐AND‐GO\nConsider an aircraft cleared for a touch‐and‐go, low approach, or practice approach as an arriving aircraft until that aircraft touches down or crosses the landing threshold; thereafter, consider the aircraft as a departing aircraft. Before the aircraft begins its final descent, issue the appropriate departure instructions the pilot is to follow upon completion of the approach (in accordance with paragraph 4-3-2, Departure Clearances). Climb‐out instructions must include a specific heading or a route of flight and altitude, except when the aircraft will maintain VFR and contact the tower.\nEXAMPLE-\n“After completing low approach, climb and maintain six thousand. Turn right, heading three six zero.”\n“Maintain VFR, contact tower.”\n(Issue other instructions as appropriate.)\nNOTE-\nClimb‐out instructions may be omitted after the first approach if instructions remain the same.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

TERMINAL. Advise pilots when these conditions exist.\nNOTE-\nAdvisory may be omitted when provided on ATIS or by other appropriate notice to pilots.\nTERMINAL. Do not use secondary radar only to conduct surveillance (ASR) final approaches unless an emergency exists and the pilot concurs.\nTargets derived from ADS-B and WAM may be used for the provision of all terminal services when operating in STARS Fusion, STARS FMA, and STARS Multi‐Sensor Mode, including those associated with any published instrument procedure annotated “radar required.”\nNOTE-\nTargets derived from WAM cannot be used to provide 3 NM separation in the EAS. 3 NM targets are not derived from WAM within the EAS.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-1-2, Exceptions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-4-2, Route Structure Transitions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-5-4, Minima Along Other Than Established Airways or Routes.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 6, Nonradar.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-4, Minima.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-2, ATC Surveillance Source Use.\nELECTRONIC ATTACK (EA) ACTIVITY\nRefer all EA activity requests to the appropriate center supervisor.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Chapter 2, Section 3, Electronic Attack (EA) Mission Coordination.\nNOTE-\nEA activity can subsequently result in a request to apply EA videos to the radar system which may necessitate the decertification of the narrowband search radar. The Systems Engineer should be consulted concerning the effect of EA on the operational use of the narrowband radar prior to approving/disapproving requests to conduct EA activity.\nWhen EA activity interferes with the operational use of radar:\nEN ROUTE. Request the responsible military unit or aircraft, if initial request was received directly from pilot, to suspend the activity.\nTERMINAL. Request suspension of the activity through the ARTCC. If immediate cessation of the activity is required, broadcast the request directly to the EA aircraft on the emergency frequency. Notify the ARTCC of direct broadcast as soon as possible.\nWhen previously suspended activity will no longer interfere:\nEN ROUTE. Inform the NORAD unit or aircraft that it may be resumed.\nTERMINAL. Inform the ARTCC or aircraft that it may be resumed. Obtain approval from the ARTCC prior to broadcasting a resume clearance directly to the aircraft.\nIn each stop request, include your facility name, type of EA activity (chaff dispensing- “stream”/“burst” or electronic jamming- “buzzer”), radar band affected and, when feasible, expected duration of suspension.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nBIG PHOTO (identification, if known) (name) CENTER/TOWER/APPROACH CONTROL.\nTo stop EA activity:\nSTOP STREAM/BURST IN AREA (area name) (degree and distance from facility),\nor\nSTOP BUZZER ON (frequency band or channel).\nTo resume EA activity:\nRESUME STREAM/BURST,\nor\nRESUME BUZZER ON (frequency band or channel).\nMERGING TARGET PROCEDURES\nExcept while they are established in a holding pattern, apply merging target procedures to all radar identified:\nAircraft at 10,000 feet and above.\nTurbojet aircraft regardless of altitude.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - TURBOJET AIRCRAFT.\nPresidential aircraft regardless of altitude.\nIssue traffic information to the aircraft listed in subparagraph a whose targets appear likely to merge unless the aircraft are separated by more than the appropriate vertical separation minima.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Traffic twelve o'clock, seven miles, eastbound, Gulfstream 650, one seven thousand.”\n“United Sixteen and American Twenty-Five, traffic twelve o'clock, one zero miles, opposite direction, eastbound Seven Thirty-Seven at flight level three three zero, westbound Airbus Three Twenty at flight level three two zero.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-21, Description of Aircraft Types.\nWhen both aircraft in subparagraph b are in RVSM airspace and vertically separated by 1,000 feet, and either pilot reports they are unable to maintain RVSM due to turbulence or mountain wave, use vectors to prevent the targets from merging.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Delta One Twenty-Three, fly heading two niner zero, vector for traffic. Traffic twelve o'clock, one zero miles, opposite direction, Seven Thirty-Seven, eastbound at flight level three one zero.”\nIf the pilot requests, vector their aircraft to avoid merging targets with the previously issued traffic.\nNOTE-\nBecause aircraft closure rates can be rapid, issue traffic with enough time for the pilot to decide if a vector is necessary.\nIf unable to provide vector service, inform the pilot.\nNOTE-\nThe phraseology “Unable RVSM due to turbulence (or mountain wave)” is only intended for severe turbulence or other weather encounters with altitude deviations of approximately 200 feet or more.\nHOLDING PATTERN SURVEILLANCE\nProvide radar surveillance of outer fix holding pattern airspace areas, or any portions thereof, shown on your radar scope (displayed on the video map or scribed on the map overlay) whenever aircraft are holding there. Attempt to detect any aircraft that stray outside the area. If you detect an aircraft straying outside the area, assist it to return to the assigned airspace.\nDEVIATION ADVISORIES\nInform an aircraft when it is observed in a position and on a track which will obviously cause the aircraft to deviate from its protected airspace area. If necessary, help the aircraft to return to the assigned protected airspace.\nNOTE-\nRNAV ATS routes have a width of 8 miles and laterally protected airspace of 4 miles on each side of the route centerline\nNavigation system performance requirements for operations on RNAV ATS routes require the aircraft system be capable of remaining within 2 miles of the route centerline. Aircraft approaching this limit may be experiencing a navigation system error or failure.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-9-3, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7400.2, Para 20-5-2, RNAV Route Criteria.\nAC 90-100A, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations, Para 8a.

After an aircraft receives the statement “radar contact” from ATC, it discontinues reporting over compulsory reporting points. It resumes normal position reporting when ATC informs it “radar contact lost” or “radar service terminated.”\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - RADAR CONTACT.\nWhen required, inform an aircraft of its position with respect to a fix or airway.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nOVER/PASSING (fix).\n(Number of miles) MILES FROM (fix).\n(Number of miles) MILES (direction) OF (fix, airway, or location).\nCROSSING/JOINING/DEPARTING (airway or route).\nINTERCEPTING/CROSSING (name of NAVAID) (specified) RADIAL.\nRADAR SERVICE TERMINATION\nInform aircraft when radar service is terminated.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR SERVICE TERMINATED (nonradar routing if required).\nRadar service is automatically terminated and the aircraft needs not be advised of termination when:\nNOTE-\nTermination of radar monitoring when conducting simultaneous ILS approaches is prescribed in paragraph 5-9-7, Simultaneous Independent Approaches- Dual & Triple.\nAn aircraft cancels its IFR flight plan, except within Class B airspace, Class C airspace, TRSA, or where basic radar service is provided.\nAn aircraft conducting an instrument, visual, or contact approach has landed or has been instructed to change to advisory frequency.\nAt tower‐controlled airports where radar coverage does not exist to within 1/2 mile of the end of the runway, arriving aircraft must be informed when radar service is terminated.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-5-6, Radar Tolerances.\nTERMINAL. An arriving VFR aircraft receiving radar service to a tower‐controlled airport within Class B airspace, Class C airspace, TRSA, or where basic radar service is provided has landed, or to all other airports, is instructed to change to tower or advisory frequency.\nTERMINAL.

Beacon/ADS-B SystemsASSIGNMENT CRITERIA\nGeneral.\nMode 3/A is designated as the common military/civil mode for air traffic control use.\nMake beacon code assignments to only ADS-B and/or transponder-equipped aircraft.\nNOTE-\nAircraft equipped with ADS-B are also still required to have an operable transponder. The ATC-assigned beacon code is one of the required message elements of ADS-B Out.\nUnless otherwise specified in this section, a facility directive, or a letter of agreement, issue beacon codes assigned by the computer. Computer-assigned codes may be modified as required.\nNOTE-\nThe computer will assign only discrete beacon codes unless all the discrete codes allocated to a facility are in use.\nTERMINAL. Aircraft that will remain within the terminal facility's delegated airspace must be assigned a code from the code subset allocated to the terminal facility.\nTERMINAL. Unless otherwise specified in a facility directive or a letter of agreement, aircraft that will enter an adjacent facility's delegated airspace must be assigned a beacon code assigned by the ARTCC computer.\nNOTE-\nThis will provide the adjacent facility advance information on the aircraft and will cause auto-acquisition of the aircraft prior to handoff. When an airborne aircraft that has been assigned a beacon code by the ARTCC computer and whose flight plan will terminate in another facility's area cancels ATC service, appropriate action should be taken to remove flight plan information on that aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK THREE/ALFA (code),\nor\nSQUAWK (code).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-4, Terminal Automation Systems Identification Methods.\nCode 4000 should be assigned when aircraft are operating on a flight plan specifying frequent or rapid changes in assigned altitude in more than one stratum or other category of flight not compatible with a discrete code assignment.\nNOTE-\nCategories of flight that can be assigned Code 4000 include certain flight test aircraft, MTR missions, aerial refueling operation requiring descent involving more than one stratum, ALTRVs where continuous monitoring of ATC frequencies is not required and frequent altitude changes are approved, and other flights requiring special handling by ATC.\nMilitary aircraft operating in restricted/warning areas or on VR routes will squawk 4000 unless another code has been assigned or coordinated with ATC.\nRADAR BEACON CODE CHANGES\nUnless otherwise specified in a directive or a letter of agreement or coordinated at the time of handoff, do not request an aircraft to change from the code it was squawking in the transferring facility's area until the aircraft is within your area of responsibility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-8, IFR‐VFR and VFR‐IFR Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nEMERGENCY CODE ASSIGNMENT\nAssign codes to emergency aircraft as follows:\nCode 7700 when the pilot declares an emergency and the aircraft is not radar identified.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK MAYDAY ON 7700.\nNOTE-\nInstead of displaying “7700\" in the data block, ERAM will display “EMRG,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “EM.”\nAfter radio and radar contact have been established, you may request other than single-piloted helicopters and single-piloted turbojet aircraft to change from Code 7700 to a computer-assigned discrete code.\nNOTE-\nThe code change, based on pilot concurrence, the nature of the emergency, and current flight conditions, will signify to other ATC facilities that the aircraft in distress is identified and under ATC control.\nPilots of single-piloted helicopters and single-piloted turbojet aircraft may be unable to change transponder settings during an emergency.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR CONTACT (position). IF FEASIBLE, SQUAWK (code).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nRADIO FAILURE\nWhen you observe a Code 7600 display, apply the procedures in paragraph 10-4-4, Communications Failure.\nNOTE-\nAn aircraft experiencing a loss of two-way radio communications capability can be expected to squawk Code 7600.\nInstead of displaying “7600” in the data block, ERAM will display “RDOF,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “RF.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nHIJACK/UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE\nWhen you observe a Code 7500 display, apply the procedures in paragraph 10-2-6, Hijacked Aircraft.\nNOTE-\nInstead of displaying “7500” in the data block, ERAM will display “HIJK,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “HJ.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nUNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) LOST LINK\nCode 7400 may be transmitted by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) when the control link between the aircraft and the pilot is lost. Lost link procedures are programmed into the flight management system and associated with the flight plan being flown.\nWhen you observe a Code 7400 display, do the following:\nNOTE-\nInstead of displaying “7400” in the data block, ERAM will display “LLNK,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “LL.”\nDetermine the lost link procedure, as outlined in the Special Airworthiness Certificate or Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA).\nCoordinate, as required, to allow UAS to execute the lost link procedure.\nAdvise the OS/CIC, when feasible, so the event can be documented.\nIf you observe or are informed by the PIC that the UAS is deviating from the programmed Lost Link procedure, or is encountering another anomaly, treat the situation in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.65 Chapter 10, Section 1, paragraph 10-1-1c.\nNOTE-\nThe available lost link procedure should, at a minimum, include lost link route of flight, lost link orbit points, lost link altitudes, communications procedures and preplanned flight termination points if the event recovery of the UAS is deemed unfeasible.\nEach lost link procedure may differ and is dependent upon airframe and operation. These items are contained in the flight's Certificate of Authorization or Waiver (COA) and must be made available to ATC personnel in their simplest form at positions responsible for Unmanned Aircraft (UAs).\nSome UA airframes (Global Hawk) will not be programmed upon the NAS Automation roll out to squawk 7400. These airframes will continue to squawk 7600 should a lost link occur. The ATC Specialist must apply the same procedures described above.\nVFR CODE ASSIGNMENTS\nFor VFR aircraft receiving radar advisories, issue a computer-assigned beacon code.\nIf the aircraft is outside of your area of responsibility and an operational benefit will be gained by retaining the aircraft on your frequency for the purpose of providing services, ensure that coordination has been effected:\nAs soon as possible after positive identification, and\nPrior to issuing a control instruction or providing a service other than a safety alert/traffic advisory.\nNOTE-\nSafety alerts/traffic advisories may be issued to an aircraft prior to coordination if an imminent situation may be averted by such action. Coordination should be effected as soon as possible thereafter.\nInstruct an IFR aircraft that cancels its IFR flight plan and is not requesting radar advisory service, or a VFR aircraft for which radar advisory service is being terminated, to squawk VFR.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK VFR.\nor\nSQUAWK 1200.\nNOTE-\nAircraft not in contact with ATC may squawk 1255 in lieu of 1200 while en route to/from or within designated firefighting areas.\nVFR aircraft that fly authorized SAR missions for the USAF or USCG may be advised to squawk 1277 in lieu of 1200 while en route to/from or within the designated search area.\nVFR gliders should squawk 1202 in lieu of 1200. Gliders operate under some flight and maneuvering limitations. They may go from essentially stationary targets while climbing and thermaling to moving targets very quickly. They can be expected to make radical changes in flight direction to find lift and cannot hold altitude in a response to an ATC request. Gliders may congregate together for short periods of time to climb together in thermals and may cruise together in loose formations while traveling between thermals.\nThe lead aircraft in a standard VFR formation flight not in contact with ATC should squawk 1203 in lieu of 1200. All other aircraft in the formation should squawk standby.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.66, National Beacon Code Allocation Plan.\nWhen an aircraft changes from VFR to IFR, assign a beacon code to Mode C equipped aircraft that will allow MSAW alarms.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nBEACON CODES FOR PRESSURE SUIT FLIGHTS AND FLIGHTS ABOVE FL 600\nSpecial use Mode 3/A codes are reserved for certain pressure suit flights and aircraft operations above FL 600 in accordance with FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations, Appendix 4, Document 2.\nEnsure that these flights remain on one of the special use codes if filed in the flight plan, except:\nWhen unforeseen events cause more than one aircraft to be in the same or adjacent ARTCC's airspace at the same time on the same special use discrete code, if necessary, you may request the pilot to make a code change, squawk standby, or stop squawk as appropriate.\nNOTE-\nCurrent FAA automation systems track multiple targets on the same beacon code with much greater reliability than their predecessors, and a code change may not be necessary for such flights.\nThe beacon code is often preset on the ground for such flights and is used throughout the flight profile, including operations below FL 600.

Such transponders must have a Mode 3/A 4096 code capability, replying to Mode 3/A interrogation with the code specified by ATC, or a Mode S capability, replying to Mode 3/A interrogations with the code specified by ATC. The aircraft must also be equipped with automatic pressure altitude reporting equipment having a Mode C capability that automatically replies to Mode C interrogations by transmitting pressure altitude information in 100‐foot increments.\nThe exception to 14 CFR section 91.215 (b) is 14 CFR section 91.215(b)(5) which states: except balloons, gliders, and aircraft without engine‐driven electrical systems.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 20, Temporary Flight Restrictions.\nExcept in an emergency, do not approve inflight requests for authorization to deviate from 14 CFR section 91.215(b)(5)(i) requirements originated by aircraft without transponder equipment installed.\nApprove or disapprove other inflight deviation requests, or withdraw approval previously issued to such flights, solely on the basis of traffic conditions and other operational factors.\nAdhere to the following sequence of action when an inflight VFR deviation request is received from an aircraft with an inoperative transponder or Mode C, or is not Mode C equipped:\nSuggest that the aircraft conduct its flight in airspace unaffected by the CFRs.\nSuggest that the aircraft file an IFR flight plan.\nSuggest that the aircraft provide a VFR route of flight and maintain radio contact with ATC.\nDo not approve an inflight deviation unless the aircraft has filed an IFR flight plan or a VFR route of flight is provided and radio contact with ATC is maintained.\nYou may approve an inflight deviation request which includes airspace outside your jurisdiction without the prior approval of the adjacent ATC sector/facility providing a transponder/Mode C status report is forwarded prior to control transfer.\nApprove or disapprove inflight deviation requests within a reasonable period of time or advise when approval/disapproval can be expected.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nBEACON TERMINATION\nInform the pilot when you want their aircraft's transponder and ADS-B Out turned off.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSTOP SQUAWK.\n(For a military aircraft when you do not know if the military service requires that it continue operating on another mode),\nSTOP SQUAWK (mode in use).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nALTITUDE FILTERS\nTERMINAL\nSet altitude filters to display Mode C altitude readouts to encompass all altitudes within the controller's jurisdiction. Set the upper limits no lower than 1,000 feet above the highest altitude for which the controller is responsible. In those stratified positions, set the lower limit to 1,000 feet or more below the lowest altitude for which the controller is responsible. When the position's area of responsibility includes down to an airport field elevation, the facility will normally set the lower altitude filter limit to encompass the field elevation so that provisions of paragraph 2-1-6, Safety Alert, and paragraph 5-2-15, Validation of Mode C Altitude Readout, subparagraph b2 may be applied. Air traffic managers may authorize temporary suspension of this requirement when target clutter is excessive.\nINOPERATIVE OR MALFUNCTIONING ADS-B TRANSMITTER\nWhen an aircraft's ADS-B transmitter appears to be inoperative or malfunctioning, notify the OS/CIC of the aircraft call sign, location, and time of the occurrence (UTC).

The intent of this paragraph is to capture ADS-B anomalies observed by ATC, such as errors in the data (other than Call Sign Mis‐Match events, which are detected and reported to AFS automatically) or instances when civil ADS-B transmissions would normally be expected but are not received (e.g., ADS-B transmissions were observed on a previous flight leg).\nIf a malfunctioning ADS-B transmitter is jeopardizing the safe execution of air traffic control functions, instruct the aircraft to stop ADS-B transmissions, and notify the OS/CIC.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSTOP ADS-B TRANSMISSIONS, AND IF ABLE, SQUAWK THREE/ALFA (code).\nNOTE-\nNot all aircraft have a capability to disengage the ADS-B transmitter independently from the beacon code squawk.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-23, ADS-B Alerts.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-33, Reporting Inoperative or Malfunctioning ADS-B Transmitters.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-4-9, ADS-B Out OFF Operations.\nFAA Order JO 7110.67, Para 19, ATC Security Procedures for ADS-B Out OFF Operations.\nADS-B ALERTS\nCall Sign Mis-Match (CSMM). A CSMM alert will occur when the transmitted ADS-B Flight Identification (FLT ID) does not match the flight plan aircraft identification. Inform the aircraft of the CSMM.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nYOUR ADS-B FLIGHT ID DOES NOT MATCH YOUR FLIGHT PLAN AIRCRAFT IDENTIFICATION.\nDuplicate ICAO Address. If the broadcast ICAO address is shared with one or more flights in the same ADS-B Service Area (regardless of altitude), and radar reinforcement is not available, target resolution may be lost on one or both targets.\nNOTE-\nDuplicate ICAO Address Alerts appear as “DA” and are associated with the Data Block (DB) on STARS systems. Duplicate ICAO Address Alerts appear as “DUP” and are associated with the DB on MEARTS systems. Duplicate ICAO Address Alerts appear as “Duplicate 24-bit Address” at the AT Specialist Workstation on ERAM systems.\nIf a CSMM or Duplicate ICAO address is jeopardizing the safe execution of air traffic control functions, instruct the aircraft to stop ADS-B transmissions, and notify the OS/CIC.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSTOP ADS-B TRANSMISSIONS, AND IF ABLE, SQUAWK THREE/ALFA (code).\nNOTE-\nNot all aircraft are capable of disengaging the ADS-B transmitter independently from the transponder.\nADS-B OUT OFF OPERATIONS\nOperators of aircraft with functional ADS-B Out avionics installed and requesting an exception from the requirement to transmit at all times must obtain authorization from FAA System Operations Security. The OS/CIC should inform you of any ADS-B Out OFF operations in your area of jurisdiction.\nDo not inform such aircraft that their ADS-B transmitter appears to be inoperative.\nDo not approve any pilot request for ADS-B Out OFF operations.

Radar IdentificationAPPLICATION\nBefore you provide radar service, establish and maintain radar identification of the aircraft involved, except as provided in paragraph 5-5-1, Application, subparagraphs b2, b3 and in paragraph 8-5-5, Radar Identification Application.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-1-1, Presentation and Equipment Performance.\nPRIMARY RADAR IDENTIFICATION METHODS\nIdentify a primary, radar beacon, or ADS-B target by using one of the following methods:\nObserving a departing aircraft target within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end at airports with an operating control tower, provided one of the following methods of coordination is accomplished.\nA verbal rolling/boundary notification is issued for each departure, or\nA nonverbal rolling/boundary notification is used for each departure aircraft.\nNOTE-\nNonverbal notification can be accomplished via the use of a manual or electronic “drop tube” or automation.\nObserving a target whose position with respect to a fix (displayed on the video map, scribed on the map overlay, or displayed as a permanent echo) or a visual reporting point (whose range and azimuth from the radar antenna has been accurately determined and made available to the controller) corresponds with a direct position report received from an aircraft, and the observed track is consistent with the reported heading or route of flight. If a TACAN/VORTAC is located within 6,000 feet of the radar antenna, the TACAN/VORTAC may be used as a reference fix for radar identification without being displayed on the video map or map overlay.\nNOTE-\nEstablishment of radar identification through use of DME position information can be complicated by the fact that some military TACANs are not collocated with frequency-paired VORs and might be separated from them by as much as 31 miles.\nVisual reporting points used for RADAR identification are limited to those most used by pilots and whose range and azimuth have been determined by supervisory personnel.\nObserving a target make an identifying turn or turns of 30 degrees or more, provided the following conditions are met:\nNOTE-\nUse of identifying turns or headings which would cause the aircraft to follow normal IFR routes or known VFR flight paths might result in misidentification. When these circumstances cannot be avoided, additional methods of identification may be necessary.\nExcept in the case of a lost aircraft, a pilot position report is received which assures you that the aircraft is within radar coverage and within the area being displayed.\nOnly one aircraft is observed making these turns.\nFor aircraft operating in accordance with an IFR clearance, you either issue a heading away from an area which will require an increased minimum IFR altitude or have the aircraft climb to the highest minimum altitude in your area of jurisdiction before you issue a heading.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-12-11, Surveillance Unusable.\nBEACON/ADS-B IDENTIFICATION METHODS\nWhen using only Mode 3/A radar beacon or ADS-B to identify a target, use one of the following methods:\nRequest the pilot to activate the “IDENT” feature of the transponder/ADS-B and then observe the identification display.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nIDENT.\nSQUAWK (code) AND IDENT.\nRequest the pilot to change to a specific discrete or nondiscrete code, as appropriate, and then observe the target or code display change. If a code change is required in accordance with Section 2, Beacon/ADS-B Systems, of this chapter, use the codes specified therein.\nRequest the pilot to change their transponder/ADS-B to “standby.” After you observe the target disappear for sufficient scans to assure that loss of target resulted from placing the transponder/ADS-B in “standby” position, request the pilot to return the transponder to normal operation and then observe the reappearance of the target.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK STANDBY,\nthen\nSQUAWK NORMAL.\nEN ROUTE. An aircraft may be considered identified when the full data block is automatically associated with the target symbol of an aircraft that is squawking a discrete code assigned by the computer.\nNOTE-\nPaired LDBs in ERAM do not display a beacon code.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK (4 digit discrete code),\nor, if aircraft's altitude reporting capability is turned off,\nSQUAWK (4 digit discrete code), SQUAWK ALTITUDE.\nNOTE-\nThe AIM informs pilots to adjust Mode C transponders and ADS-B with altitude reporting capability activated unless deactivation is requested by ATC. “Squawk altitude” is included here to provide applicable phraseology.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-6, Position Information.\nTERMINAL AUTOMATION SYSTEMS IDENTIFICATION METHODS\nTERMINAL\nConsider an auto‐acquired aircraft as identified when the data block is displayed and is visible to you, and one of the following conditions exist:\nThe radar or beacon identification procedures have been used to confirm the identity of the tagged target.\nThe aircraft is being handed off using a NAS automated system and one of the following does not appear in the data block: “CST”, “NAT”, “NT”, “AMB”, “OLD”, “AM”, or “TRK”.\nUse the data block to maintain target identity unless it is in a coast status or displaced from the appropriate target.\nA displaced data block must be updated at all times.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nQUESTIONABLE IDENTIFICATION\nUse more than one method of identification when proximity of targets, duplication of observed action, or any other circumstances cause doubt as to target identification.\nIf identification is questionable for any reason, take immediate action to re-identify the aircraft or terminate radar service. Identify the aircraft as follows:\nAs described in paragraph 5-3-2, Primary Radar Identification Methods, or paragraph 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nEn route.  Ensure that all primary targets are displayed when radar identification is lost or is questionable.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nPOSITION INFORMATION\nInform an aircraft of its position whenever radar identification is established by means of identifying turns or by any of the beacon identification methods outlined in paragraph 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods. Position information need not be given when identification is established by position correlation or when a departing aircraft is identified within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end.\nIDENTIFICATION STATUS\nInform an aircraft of radar contact when:\nInitial radar identification in the ATC system is established.\nSubsequent to loss of radar contact or terminating radar service, radar identification is reestablished.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR CONTACT (position if required).\nInform an aircraft when radar contact is lost.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR CONTACT LOST (alternative instructions when required).\nDATA BLOCKS\nEN ROUTE\nRetain data blocks that are associated with the appropriate target symbol in order to maintain continuous identity of aircraft. Retain the data block until the aircraft has exited the sector or delegated airspace, and all potential conflicts have been resolved; including an aircraft that is a point out. The data block must display flight identification and altitude information, as a minimum. The displayed altitude may be assigned, interim, or reported.\nERAM: When you have separation responsibility for an aircraft and a paired track exists, display a full data block (FDB).\nDATA BLOCKS\nTERMINAL\nRetain data blocks that are associated with the appropriate target symbol in order to maintain continuous identity of aircraft. Retain the data block until the aircraft has exited the sector or delegated airspace, and all potential conflicts have been resolved; including an aircraft that is a point out. The data block must display flight identification and altitude information, as a minimum.\nNOTE-\nWhere delegated airspace extends beyond Class B and/or Class C airspace, the following will apply: If a VFR aircraft is clear of Class B and Class C airspace and radar services have been terminated then retention of the data block is no longer required.\nDuring prearranged coordination procedures, the controllers who penetrate another controller's airspace must display data block information of that controller's aircraft which must contain, at a minimum, the position symbol and altitude information.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-9, Prearranged Coordination.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-6, Prearranged Coordination.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Transfer of Radar IdentificationAPPLICATION\nTo provide continuous radar service to an aircraft and facilitate a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of traffic, it is often necessary to transfer radar identification of an aircraft from one controller to another. This section describes the terms, methods, and responsibilities associated with this task. Interfacility and intrafacility transfers of radar identification must be accomplished in all areas of radar surveillance except where it is not operationally feasible. Where such constraints exist, they must be:\nCovered in letters of agreement which clearly state that control will not be based upon a radar handoff, or\nCoordinated by the transferring and receiving controllers for a specified period of time.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-8, Coordination with Receiving Facility.\nTERMS\nHandoff. An action taken to transfer the radar identification of an aircraft from one controller to another controller if the aircraft will enter the receiving controller's airspace and radio communications with the aircraft will be transferred.\nRadar Contact. The term used to inform the controller initiating a handoff that the aircraft is identified and approval is granted for the aircraft to enter the receiving controller's airspace.\nPoint Out. An action taken by a controller to transfer the radar identification of an aircraft to another controller and radio communications will not be transferred.\nPoint Out Approved. The term used to inform the controller initiating a point out that the aircraft is identified and that approval is granted for the aircraft to enter the receiving controller's airspace, as coordinated, without a communications transfer or the appropriate automated system response.\nTraffic. A term used to transfer radar identification of an aircraft to another controller for the purpose of coordinating separation action. Traffic is normally issued:\nIn response to a handoff or point out;\nIn anticipation of a handoff or point out; or\nIn conjunction with a request for control of an aircraft.\nTraffic Observed. The term used to inform the controller issuing the traffic restrictions that the traffic is identified and that the restrictions issued are understood and will be complied with.\nMETHODS\nTransfer the radar identification of an aircraft by at least one of the following methods:\nPhysically point to the target on the receiving controller's display.\nUse landline voice communications.\nUse automation capabilities.\nNOTE-\nAutomated handoff capabilities are only available when FDP is operational.\nTERMINAL. Use the “Modify” or “Quick Look” functions for data transfer between the TRACON and tower cab only if specific procedures are established in a facility directive. The local controller has the responsibility to determine whether or not conditions are adequate for the use of STARS data on the TDW.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 12-6-4, Use of Stars Quick Look Functions.\nWhen making a handoff, point out, or issuing traffic restrictions, relay information to the receiving controller in the following order:\nThe position of the target relative to a fix, map symbol, or radar target known and displayed by both the receiving and transferring controller. Mileage from the reference point may be omitted when relaying the position of a target if a full data block associated with the target has been forced on the receiving controller's radar display.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Point out, Southwest of Richmond VOR . . ..”\nThe aircraft identification, as follows:\nThe aircraft call sign, or\nThe discrete beacon code of the aircraft during interfacility point outs only, if both the receiving and the transferring controllers agree.\nNOTE-\nAcceptance of a point out using the discrete beacon code as the aircraft's identification constitutes agreement.\nEN ROUTE. The Computer Identification Number (CID) during intrafacility point outs.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Point Out, Southwest of Richmond VOR, C-I-D 123…”\nThe assigned altitude, appropriate restrictions, and information that the aircraft is climbing or descending, if applicable, except when inter/intrafacility directives ensure that the altitude information will be known by the receiving controller.\nNOTE-\nWhen physically pointing to the target, you do not have to state the aircraft position.\nAdvise the receiving controller of pertinent information not contained in the data block or available flight data unless covered in an LOA or facility directive. Pertinent information may include:\nAssigned heading.\nSpeed/altitude restrictions.\nObserved track or deviation from the last route clearance.\nAny other pertinent information.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHANDOFF/POINT-OUT/TRAFFIC (aircraft position), (aircraft ID or discrete beacon code), (altitude, restrictions, and other pertinent information, if applicable).\nWhen receiving a handoff, point out, or traffic restrictions, respond to the transferring controller as follows:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Aircraft ID) (restrictions, if applicable) RADAR CONTACT,\nor\n(aircraft ID or discrete beacon code) (restrictions, if applicable) POINT OUT APPROVED,\nor\nTRAFFIC OBSERVED,\nor\nUNABLE (appropriate information, as required).\nIf any doubt as to target identification exists after attempting confirmation in accordance with this section, apply the provisions of paragraph 5-3-5, Questionable Identification.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-15, Validation of Mode C Altitude Readout.\nTRAFFIC\nWhen using the term “traffic” for coordinating separation, the controller issuing traffic must issue appropriate restrictions.\nThe controller accepting the restrictions must be responsible to ensure that approved separation is maintained between the involved aircraft.\nTRANSFERRING CONTROLLER HANDOFF\nUnless otherwise coordinated or specified in an LOA or facility directive, the transferring controller must:\nComplete a handoff prior to an aircraft entering the airspace delegated to the receiving controller.\nVerbally obtain the receiving controller's approval prior to making any changes to an aircraft's flight path, altitude, speed, or data block information while the handoff is being initiated or after acceptance.\nAdvise the receiving controller of pertinent information not contained in the data block or flight progress strip, including:\nAssigned heading.\nAirspeed restrictions.\nAltitude information issued.\nObserved track or deviation from the last route clearance.\nThe beacon code, if different from that normally used or previously coordinated.\nAny other pertinent information.\nInitiate verbal coordination to verify the position of primary or nondiscrete targets, except for intrafacility automated handoffs in STARS, ERAM, or MEARTS in Fused Display Mode.\nInitiate verbal coordination before transferring control of a track when “CST,” “FAIL,” “NONE,” “IF,” “NT,” or “TRK” is displayed in the data block.\nAdvise the receiving controller if radar monitoring is required.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-1-2, Exceptions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-4-2, Route Structure Transitions.\nConsider the target being transferred as identified on the receiving controller's display when the receiving controller acknowledges receipt verbally or accepts the automated handoff.\nPrior to transferring communications:\nResolve any potential violations of adjacent airspace and potential conflicts with other aircraft in your area of jurisdiction.\nCoordinate with any controller whose area of jurisdiction the aircraft will transit prior to entering the receiving controller's area of jurisdiction.\nForward to the receiving controller any restrictions issued to ensure separation.\nComply with restrictions issued by the receiving controller.\nComply with the provisions of paragraph 2-1-17, Radio Communications. To the extent possible, transfer communications when the handoff has been accepted.\nNOTE-\nBefore the STARS “modify/quick look” function is used to effect a handoff, a facility directive that specifies communication transfer points is required.\nAfter transferring communications, continue to comply with the requirements of subparagraphs h1 and h2.\nBefore releasing control of the aircraft, issue restrictions to the receiving controller that are necessary to maintain separation from other aircraft within your area of jurisdiction.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-15, Control Transfer.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-6, Receiving Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-10, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nRECEIVING CONTROLLER HANDOFF\nThe receiving controller must:\nEnsure that the target position corresponds with the position given by the transferring controller or that there is an appropriate association between an automated data block and the target being transferred before accepting a handoff.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-15, Control Transfer.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff.\nIssue restrictions that are needed for the aircraft to enter your sector safely before accepting the handoff.\nComply with restrictions issued by the transferring controller unless otherwise coordinated.\nAfter accepting a handoff from another facility, confirm the identification of a primary target by advising the aircraft of its position, and of a nondiscrete beacon target by observing a code change, an “ident” reply, or a “standby” squawk unless one of these was used during handoff. These provisions do not apply at those towers and GCAs that have been delegated the responsibility for providing radar separation within designated areas by the overlying approach control facility and the aircraft identification is assured by sequencing or positioning prior to the handoff.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-5, Approach Separation Responsibility.\nConsider a beacon target's identity to be confirmed when:\nThe data block associated with the target being handed off indicates the computer assigned discrete beacon code is being received; or\nYou observe the deletion of a discrete code that was displayed in the data block; or\nNOTE-\nWhen the beacon code received from the aircraft does not match the computer assigned beacon code, the code received (ERAM, MEARTS) or the site-adapted code (received, computer-assigned, or both for STARS) will be displayed in the data block. When the aircraft changes to the computer assigned code, the code is automatically removed from the data block. In this instance, the observance of code removal from the data block satisfies confirmation requirements.\nYou observe the numeric display of a discrete code that an aircraft has been instructed to squawk or reports squawking.\nTake the identified action prior to accepting control of a track when the following indicators are displayed in the data block:\n“AMB” or “AM”: advise the other facility that a disparity exists between the position declared by their computer and the position declared by your STARS/MEARTS system.\n“NAT” or “NT”: advise the other facility if a disparity exists between the position declared by their computer and the actual target position.\n“DATA,” “CST,” “NONE,” or “OLD”: initiate verbal coordination.\nERAM: Notify the OS/CIC when a MISM is displayed in the data block.\nAdvise the transferring controller as soon as possible if you will delay the climb or descent of the aircraft through the vertical limits of that controller's area of jurisdiction, unless otherwise specified in an LOA or a facility directive.\nPOINT OUT\nThe transferring controller must:\nObtain approval before permitting an aircraft to enter the receiving controller's delegated airspace.\nEN ROUTE: Automated approval may be utilized in lieu of verbal approval. If the receiving controller takes no action, revert to verbal procedures.\nNOTE-\nUse fourth line data for aircraft not on their flight plan route.\nWhere specified in a letter of agreement, some facilities may restrict interfacility automated point outs.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-10-1, En Route Or Oceanic Sector Team Responsibilities.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-10, En Route Fourth Line Data Block Usage.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-3, Computer Entry of Flight Plan Information.\nTERMINAL: Automated point out approval may be utilized in lieu of verbal provided the procedures are contained in a facility directive/LOA.\nObtain the receiving controller's approval before making any changes to an aircraft's flight path, altitude, speed, or data block information after the point out has been approved.\nComply with restrictions issued by the receiving controller unless otherwise coordinated.\nBe responsible for subsequent radar handoffs and communications transfer, including flight data revisions and coordination, unless otherwise agreed to by the receiving controller or as specified in a LOA.\nThe receiving controller must:\nEnsure that the target position corresponds with the position given by the transferring controller or that there is an association between a computer data block and the target being transferred prior to approving a point out.\nBe responsible for separation between point out aircraft and other aircraft for which he/she has separation responsibility.\nIssue restrictions necessary to provide separation from other aircraft within his/her area of jurisdiction.\nAUTOMATED INFORMATION TRANSFER (AIT)\nTransfer radar identification, altitude control, and/or en route fourth line control information, without verbal coordination under the following conditions:\nDuring radar handoff; and\nVia information displayed in full data blocks; and\nWhen following procedures specified in your facility AIT directive and/or LOA.\nNOTE-\nInformation transferred using AIT procedures may be bi-directional, and may involve more than two sectors. Complete coordination, awareness of traffic flow, and understanding of each position's responsibilities concerning AIT procedures cannot be overemphasized.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-10, En Route Fourth Line Data Block Usage.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-10, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nPREARRANGED COORDINATION\nPrearranged coordination allowing aircraft under your control to enter another controller's area of jurisdiction may only be approved provided procedures are established and published in a facility directive in accordance with FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 3-6-6, Prearranged Coordination.\nNOTE-\nUnder no circumstances may one controller permit an aircraft to enter another's airspace without proper coordination. Coordination can be accomplished by several means; i.e., radar handoff, automated information transfer, verbal, point-out, and by prearranged coordination procedures identified in a facility directive that clearly describe the correct application. Airspace boundaries should not be permitted to become barriers to the efficient movement of traffic. In addition, complete coordination, awareness of traffic flow, and understanding of each position's responsibility concerning penetration of another's airspace cannot be overemphasized.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-6, Prearranged Coordination.\nEN ROUTE FOURTH LINE DATA BLOCK USAGE\nThe fourth line of the data block must be displayed. When using the fourth line for forwarding control information, only messages specified in this section, a facility directive or LOA are authorized. Any additional control information must be forwarded via other communications methods. Free text may be used by individual sector teams for recording information the team deems appropriate for managing the sector, but must be removed prior to initiation of identification transfer.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff, Subpara b.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nThe en route fourth line data block area must be used for coordination purposes only in association with radar identified aircraft.\nWhen automated information transfer (AIT) procedures are applied, en route fourth line usage for transfer of control information must be specifically defined within facility AIT directive.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-10, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nCoordination format for assigned headings must use the designation character “H” preceding a three-digit number.\nEXAMPLE-\nH080, H270\nAircraft assigned a heading until receiving a fix or joining a published route must be designated with assigned heading format followed by the fix or route.\nNOTE-\nThe notation “PH” may be used to denote present heading.\nThe character “H” may be omitted as a prefix to the heading assignment only if necessary due to character field limitations, and it does not impede understanding.\nEXAMPLE-\nH080/ALB, 080/J121, PH/ALB\nCoordination format for weather deviations must use the designated characters:\nD-deviation\nL-left\nR-right\nN-north\nE-east\nS-south\nW-west\n/F-direct next NAVAID/waypoint in the flight plan\nD(heading)-(heading)-deviate between two specified headings.\nNOTE-\nTwo digits specify turns in degrees and must include direction character(s). Three digits specify heading(s).\nThe inclusion of /(NAVAID) or /(waypoint), when preceded by the designated characters for weather deviations, indicates that a pilot has been authorized to deviate for weather and rejoin the route at the specified NAVAID or waypoint. The use of /F, following the designated weather deviation characters, indicates that a pilot has been authorized to deviate and rejoin the route of flight at the next fix in the route in accordance with paragraph 2-6-4.\nEXAMPLE-\nD90L/ATL, DL/KD75U, D090/F\nThe absence of /NAVAID, /waypoint, or /F after the weather deviation designated characters indicates that the pilot has been authorized to deviate for weather, and the receiving controller must provide a clearance to rejoin the route of flight in accordance with subparagraph 2-1-15c.\nEXAMPLE-\nDN, D20L, D30R, D180-210\nCoordination format for specific assigned airspeeds must use the designation character “S” preceding a three‐digit number. A three-digit number followed by a “+” must be used to denote an assigned speed at or greater than the displayed value, or followed by a “-” to denote an assigned speed at or less than the displayed value.\nEXAMPLE-\nS210, 250+, 280-\nAircraft assigned a Mach number must use the designation “M”, “M.”, or “.” preceding the two‐digit assigned value. The displayed Mach number must also be followed by a “+” to denote an assigned speed at or greater than the displayed value, or a “-” to denote an assigned speed at or less than the displayed value.\nEXAMPLE-\nM80, M80+, M80-, M.80, .80, .80-\nCoordination format for aircraft authorized to conduct celestial navigation training within 30 NM of the route centerline specified within the en route clearance must use “CELNAV.”\nCoordination format for aircraft requesting an altitude change must use the designation characters “RQ” preceding a three‐digit number.\nEXAMPLE-\nRQ170, RQ410\nCoordination format for aircraft requesting a route change must use the designation “RQ/” preceding a specific fix identifier.\nEXAMPLE-\nRQ/LAX, RQ/NEUTO\nThe acceptance of a handoff by the receiving controller must constitute receipt of the information contained within the en route fourth line data block.This information must not be modified outside of the controller's area of jurisdiction unless verbally coordinated or specified in a Letter of Agreement or Facility Directive. It is the responsibility of the receiving controller to advise the transferring controller if any information is not understood, or needs to be revised.\nNOTE-\nDue to system and character limitations the usage of these standardized entries may require additional support via facility directive in order to provide complete coordination.\nAll other control information must be coordinated via other methods.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Single Sensor ASR or Digital Terminal Automation System (DTAS):\nNOTE-\nIncludes single sensor long range radar mode.\nADS-B and WAM are not selectable sources when in Single Sensor Mode.\nWhen less than 40 miles from the antenna- 3 miles.\nWhen 40 miles or more from the antenna- 5 miles.\nFor single sensor monopulse secondary surveillance radar (MSSR), when less than 60 miles from the antenna- 3 miles.\nNOTE-\nWake turbulence procedures specify increased separation minima required for certain classes of aircraft because of the possible effects of wake turbulence.\nIf TRK appears in the data block, handle in accordance with paragraph 5-3-7, Identification Status, subparagraph b, and take appropriate steps to establish nonradar separation.\nNOTE-\nTRK appears in the data block whenever the aircraft is being tracked by a radar site other than the radar currently selected. Current equipment limitations preclude a target from being displayed in the single sensor mode; however, a position symbol and data block, including altitude information, will still be displayed. Therefore, low altitude alerts must be provided in accordance with paragraph 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nTERMINAL. FUSION:\nFusion target symbol - 3 miles.\nWhen displaying ISR in the data block- 5 miles.\nNOTE-\nIn the event of an unexpected ISR on one or more aircraft, the ATCS working that aircraft must transition from 3‐mile to 5‐mile separation, or establish some other form of approved separation as soon as feasible. This action must be timely, but taken in a reasonable fashion, using the controller's best judgment, as not to reduce safety or the integrity of the traffic situation. For example, if ISR appears when an aircraft is established on final with another aircraft on short final, it would be beneficial from a safety perspective to allow the trailing aircraft to continue the approach and land rather than terminate a stabilized approach.\nIf TRK appears in the data block, handle in accordance with paragraph 5-3-7, Identification Status, subparagraph b, and take appropriate steps to establish nonradar separation.\nThe ADS-B Computer Human Interface (CHI) may be implemented by facilities on a sector by sector or facility wide basis when the determination is made that utilization of the ADS-B CHI provides an operational advantage to the controller.\nSTARS Multi-Sensor Mode - 5 miles.\nNOTE-\nSTARS Multi-Sensor Mode displays target symbols derived from radar, ADS-B, and WAM.\nERAM:\nBelow FL 600- 5 miles.\nAt or above FL 600- 10 miles.\nUp to and including FL 230 where all the following conditions are met - 3 miles:\nWithin the 3 NM separation area, and:\nWithin 40 NM of the preferred radar; or\nWithin 60 NM of the preferred radar when using an MSSR; or\nWhen operating in track-based display mode.\nThe preferred sensor and/or ADS-B is providing reliable targets.\nFacility directives specifically define the 3 NM separation area.\nThe 3 NM separation area is displayable on the video map.\nInvolved aircraft are displayed using the 3 NM target symbol.\nNOTE-\nADS-B allows the expanded use of 3 NM separation in approved areas.

In accordance with the following criteria, all other approved separation may be discontinued and passing or diverging separation applied when:\nSingle Site ASR or FUSION Mode\nAircraft are on opposite/reciprocal courses and you have observed that they have passed each other; or aircraft are on same or crossing courses/assigned radar vectors and one aircraft has crossed the projected course of the other, and the angular difference between their courses/assigned radar vectors is at least 15 degrees.\nNOTE-\nTwo aircraft, both assigned courses and/or radar vectors with an angular difference of at least 15 degrees, is considered a correct application of this paragraph.\nThe tracks are monitored to ensure that the primary targets, beacon control slashes, FUSION target symbols, or full digital terminal system primary and/or beacon target symbols will not touch.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-2-2, Course Definitions.\nSingle Site ARSR or FUSION Mode when target refresh is only from an ARSR or when in FUSION Mode - ISR is displayed.\nAircraft are on opposite/reciprocal courses and you have observed that they have passed each other; or aircraft are on same or crossing courses/assigned radar vectors and one aircraft has crossed the projected course of the other, and the angular difference between their courses/assigned radar vectors is at least 45 degrees.\nNOTE-\nTwo aircraft, both assigned courses and/or radar vectors with an angular difference of at least 45 degrees, is considered a correct application of this paragraph.\nThe tracks are monitored to ensure that the primary targets, beacon control slashes, FUSION target symbols, or full digital terminal system primary and/or beacon target symbols will not touch.\nAlthough approved separation may be discontinued, the requirements of paragraph 5-5-4, Minima, subparagraph g must be applied when wake turbulence separation is required.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-2-2, Course Definitions.\nEN ROUTE, TERMINAL (when STARS Multi-Sensor Mode is selected). Vertical separation between aircraft may be discontinued when they are on opposite courses as defined in paragraph 1-2-2, Course Definitions; and\nYou are in communications with both aircraft involved; and\nYou tell the pilot of one aircraft about the other aircraft, including position, direction, type; and\nOne pilot reports having seen the other aircraft and that the aircraft have passed each other; and\nYou have observed that the radar targets have passed each other; and\nYou have advised the pilots if either aircraft is classified as a super or heavy aircraft.\nAlthough vertical separation may be discontinued, the requirements of paragraph 5-5-4, Minima, subparagraph g must be applied when wake turbulence separation is required.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Traffic, twelve o'clock, Boeing Seven Twenty Seven, opposite direction. Do you have it in sight?”\n(If the answer is in the affirmative):\n“Report passing the traffic.”\n(When pilot reports passing the traffic and the radar targets confirm that the traffic has passed, issue appropriate control instructions.)\nADDITIONAL SEPARATION FOR FORMATION FLIGHTS\nBecause of the distance allowed between formation aircraft and lead aircraft, additional separation is necessary to ensure the periphery of the formation is adequately separated from other aircraft, adjacent airspace, or obstructions. Provide supplemental separation for formation flights as follows:\nSeparate a standard formation flight by adding 1 mile to the appropriate radar separation minima.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-13, Formation Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-7-3, Separation.\nP/CG Term - FORMATION FLIGHT.\nSeparate two standard formation flights from each other by adding 2 miles to the appropriate separation minima.\nSeparate a nonstandard formation flight by applying the appropriate separation minima to the perimeter of the airspace encompassing the nonstandard formation or from the outermost aircraft of the nonstandard formation whichever applies.\nIf necessary for separation between a nonstandard formation and other aircraft, assign an appropriate beacon code to each aircraft in the formation or to the first and last aircraft in‐trail.\nNOTE-\nThe additional separation provided in paragraph 5-5-8, Additional Separation for Formation Flights, is not normally added to wake turbulence separation when a formation is following a heavier aircraft since none of the formation aircraft are likely to be closer to the heavier aircraft than the lead aircraft (to which the prescribed wake turbulence separation has been applied).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-13, Military Aerial Refueling.\nSEPARATION FROM OBSTRUCTIONS\nTERMINAL.

Vertical separation of aircraft above a prominent obstruction depicted on the radar display and contained within a buffer area may be discontinued after the aircraft has passed the obstruction.\nEAS. Apply the radar separation minima specified in paragraph 5-5-4, Minima.\nADJACENT AIRSPACE\nIf coordination between the controllers concerned has not been effected, separate radar‐controlled aircraft from the boundary of adjacent airspace in which radar separation is also being used by the following minima:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nWhen less than 40 miles from the antenna- 1 1/2 miles.\nWhen 40 miles or more from the antenna- 2 1/2 miles.\nEAS:\nBelow Flight Level 600- 2 1/2 miles.\nFlight Level 600 and above- 5 miles.\nSeparate radar‐controlled aircraft from the boundary of airspace in which nonradar separation is being used by the following minima:\nWhen less than 40 miles from the antenna- 3 miles.\nWhen 40 miles or more from the antenna- 5 miles.\nEAS:\nBelow Flight Level 600- 5 miles.\nFlight Level 600 and above- 10 miles.\nThe provisions of subparagraphs a and b do not apply to VFR aircraft being provided Class B, Class C, or TRSA services. Ensure that the targets of these aircraft do not touch the boundary of adjacent airspace.\nVFR aircraft approaching Class B, Class C, Class D, or TRSA airspace which is under the control jurisdiction of another air traffic control facility should either be provided with a radar handoff or be advised that radar service is terminated, given their position in relation to the Class B, Class C, Class D, or TRSA airspace, and the ATC frequency, if known, for the airspace to be entered. These actions should be accomplished in sufficient time for the pilot to obtain the required ATC approval prior to entering the airspace involved, or to avoid the airspace.\nEDGE OF SCOPE\nSeparate a radar‐controlled aircraft climbing or descending through the altitude of an aircraft that has been tracked to the edge of the scope/display by the following minima until nonradar separation has been established:\nWhen less than 40 miles from the antenna- 3 miles from edge of scope.\nWhen 40 miles or more from the antenna- 5 miles from edge of scope.\nEAS:\nBelow Flight Level 600- 5 miles.\nFlight Level 600 and above- 10 miles.\nBEACON TARGET DISPLACEMENT\nWhen using a radar target display with a previously specified beacon target displacement to separate a beacon target from a primary target, adjacent airspace, obstructions, or terrain, add a 1 mile correction factor to the applicable minima. The maximum allowable beacon target displacement which may be specified by the facility air traffic manager is 1/2 mile.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-4, Monitoring of Mode 3/A Radar Beacon Codes.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Speed AdjustmentAPPLICATION\nKeep speed adjustments to the minimum necessary to achieve or maintain required or desired spacing.  Avoid adjustments requiring alternate decreases and increases. Terminate speed adjustments when no longer needed.\nNOTE-\nIt is the pilot's responsibility and prerogative to refuse speed adjustment that he/she considers excessive or contrary to the aircraft's operating specifications.\nConsider the following when applying speed control:\nDetermine the interval required and the point at which the interval is to be accomplished.\nImplement speed adjustment based on the following principles.\nPriority of speed adjustment instructions is determined by the relative speed and position of the aircraft involved and the spacing requirement.\nSpeed adjustments are not achieved instantaneously. Aircraft configuration, altitudes, and speed determine the time and distance required to accomplish the adjustment.\nUse the following techniques in speed control situations:\nCompensate for compression when assigning air speed adjustment in an in‐trail situation by using one of the following techniques:\nReduce the trailing aircraft first.\nIncrease the leading aircraft first.\nAssign a specific airspeed if required to maintain spacing.\nAllow increased time and distance to achieve speed adjustments in the following situations:\nHigher altitudes.\nGreater speed.\nClean configurations.\nEnsure that aircraft are allowed to operate in a clean configuration as long as circumstances permit.\nKeep the number of speed adjustments per aircraft to the minimum required to achieve and maintain spacing.\nDo not assign speed adjustment to aircraft:\nAt or above FL 390 without pilot consent.\nExecuting a published high altitude instrument approach procedure.\nIn a holding pattern.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-6-4, Holding Instructions.\nInside the final approach fix on final or a point 5 miles from the runway, whichever is closer to the runway.\nAt the time approach clearance or a climb via/descend via clearance is issued, previously assigned speeds must be restated if required.\nApproach clearances or climb via/descend via clearances cancel any previously assigned speeds. Pilots are expected to make their own speed adjustments to fly the approach, SID, or STAR unless assigned speeds are restated.\nNOTE-\nPilots are required to comply with published speed restrictions.\nA speed restriction published as part of a SID/STAR is canceled when an aircraft is vectored off, or a deviation from the SID/STAR is approved. If necessary, assign a speed in conjunction with the vector or approval to deviate.\nNOTE-\nThe last published speed on a STAR will be maintained by the aircraft until ATC deletes it, assigns a new speed, issues a vector, assigns a direct route or issues an approach clearance.\nWhen issuing speed adjustments to aircraft cleared along a route or procedure that has published speed restrictions, if feasible, advise the pilot where you intend on allowing the aircraft to resume the published speed.\nNOTE-\nIf it is anticipated that an aircraft will be allowed to resume the published speeds on a procedure, advising the pilot where that may occur avoids flight crews from unnecessarily deleting speeds from the Flight Management System.\nExpress speed adjustments in terms of knots based on indicated airspeed (IAS) in 5‐knot increments. At or above FL 240, speeds may be expressed in terms of Mach numbers in 0.01 increments for aircraft with Mach meters (Mach 0.69, 0.70, 0.71, etc.).\nNOTE-\nPilots complying with speed adjustment instructions (published or assigned) should maintain a speed within plus or minus 10 knots or 0.02 Mach number of the specified speed.\nWhen assigning speeds to achieve spacing between aircraft at different altitudes, consider that ground speed may vary with altitude. Further speed adjustment may be necessary to attain the desired spacing.\nControllers should anticipate pilots will begin adjusting speed at the minimum distance necessary prior to a published speed restriction so as to cross the waypoint/fix at the published speed. Once at the published speed, controllers should expect pilots will maintain the published speed until additional adjustment is required to comply with further published restrictions or ATC assigned speed restrictions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-7-2, Methods.\nMETHODS\nInstruct aircraft to:\nMaintain present/specific speed.\nMaintain specified speed or greater/less.\nMaintain the highest/lowest practical speed.\nIncrease or reduce to a specified speed in single‐digit form or by a specified number of knots in group form.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSAY AIRSPEED.\nSAY MACH NUMBER.\nMAINTAIN PRESENT SPEED.\nMAINTAIN (specific speed) KNOTS.\nMAINTAIN (specific speed) KNOTS OR GREATER.\nDO NOT EXCEED (speed) KNOTS.\nMAINTAIN MAXIMUM FORWARD SPEED.\nMAINTAIN SLOWEST PRACTICAL SPEED.\nINCREASE/REDUCE SPEED:\nTO (specified speed in knots),\nor\nTO MACH (Mach number),\nor\n(number of knots) KNOTS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Increase speed to Mach point seven two.”\n“Reduce speed to two five zero.”\n“Reduce speed twenty knots.”\n“Maintain two eight zero knots.”\n“Maintain maximum forward speed.”\nNOTE-\nA pilot operating at or above 10,000 feet MSL on an assigned speed adjustment greater than 250 knots is expected to comply with 14 CFR section 91.117(a) when cleared below 10,000 feet MSL, within domestic airspace, without notifying ATC. Pilots are expected to comply with the other provisions of 14 CFR section 91.117 without notification.\nSpeed restrictions of 250 knots do not apply to aircraft operating beyond 12 NM from the coastline within the U.S. Flight Information Region, in offshore Class E airspace below 10,000 feet MSL. However, in airspace underlying a Class B airspace area designated for an airport, or in a VFR corridor designated through such a Class B airspace area, pilots are expected to comply with the 200 knot speed limit specified in 14 CFR section 91.117(c). (See 14 CFR sections 91.117(c) and 91.703.)\nThe phrases “maintain maximum forward speed” and “maintain slowest practical speed” are primarily intended for use when sequencing a group of aircraft. As the sequencing plan develops, it may be necessary to determine the specific speed and/or make specific speed assignments.\nTo obtain pilot concurrence for a speed adjustment at or above FL 390, as required by paragraph 5-7-1, Application, use the following phraseology.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Speed adjustment), IF UNABLE ADVISE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Reduce speed to one niner zero, if unable advise.”\nSimultaneous speed reduction and descent can be extremely difficult, particularly for turbojet aircraft. Specifying which action is to be accomplished first removes any doubt the pilot may have as to controller intent or priority. Specify which action is expected first when combining speed reduction with a descent clearance.\nSpeed reductions prior to descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREDUCE SPEED:\nTO (specified speed),\nor\n(number of knots) KNOTS.\nTHEN, DESCEND AND MAINTAIN (altitude).\nSpeed reduction following descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDESCEND AND MAINTAIN (altitude).\nTHEN, REDUCE SPEED:\nTO (specified speed in knots),\nor\nTO MACH (Mach number),\nor\n(number of knots) KNOTS.\nNOTE-\nWhen specifying descent prior to speed reduction, consider the maximum speed requirements specified in 14 CFR section 91.117. It may be necessary for the pilot to level off temporarily and reduce speed prior to descending below 10,000 feet MSL.\nSpecify combined speed/altitude fix crossing restrictions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCROSS (fix) AT AND MAINTAIN (altitude) AT (specified speed) KNOTS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cross Robinsville at and maintain six thousand at two three zero knots.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-17, Numbers Usage.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-7, Altitude Information.\nWhen issuing speed adjustments to aircraft cleared on procedures with published speed restrictions, specify the point at which the issued restriction begins, ends, or changes the published restrictions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCROSS (fix/waypoint) AT (speed).\nMAINTAIN (speed) UNTIL (fix/waypoint),\nTHEN (additional instructions).\nRESUME PUBLISHED SPEED.\nCOMPLY WITH SPEED RESTRICTIONS.\n(if required) EXCEPT (alternate instructions).\nDELETE SPEED RESTRICTIONS.\nCLIMB/DESCEND VIA (SID/STAR name and number) (transition if required.)\nNOTE-\nAircraft will meet all published speed restrictions when on any route or procedure with published speed restrictions regardless of climb via or descend via clearance.\nDue to variations of aircraft types, Flight Management Systems, and environmental conditions, ATC should anticipate that aircraft will begin speed adjustments at varying locations along cleared routes or procedures that contain published speed restrictions.\nIssuing speed adjustments to aircraft flying procedures with published speed restrictions may impact the pilot's ability to fly the intended flight profile of the procedure.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cross Alisa at  two two zero knots, then climb via the TIMMY One departure.”\nNOTE-\nThe aircraft will maintain the ATC assigned speed until Alisa waypoint and will then comply with the speed restrictions on the TIMMY One departure.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cross Alisa at one zero thousand, then climb via the TIMMY One departure, except maintain two two zero knots.”\nNOTE-\nThe aircraft will maintain the ATC assigned speed of two two zero knots and will not meet any published speed restrictions. Aircraft will meet all published altitude restrictions after Alisa.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Maintain two two zero knots until BALTR then resume published speed.”\nNOTE-\nThe ATC assigned speed assignment of two two zero knots would apply until BALTR. The aircraft would then comply with the published speed restrictions.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Descend via the KEPEC Two arrival, except after NIPZO maintain one eight zero knots.”\nNOTE-\nThe aircraft will comply with all published restrictions.  After NIPZO, the aircraft will continue to comply with altitude restrictions, but will comply with the ATC assigned speed adjustment.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-17, Numbers Usage.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-7, Altitude Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-7-1, Application.\nSPEED ASSIGNMENTS\nWhen assigning airspeeds, use the following:\nTo aircraft operating between FL 280 and 10,000 feet, a speed not less than 250 knots or the equivalent Mach number.\nNOTE-\nOn a standard day the Mach numbers equivalent to 250 knots calibrated airspeed (CAS) (subject to minor variations) are:\nFL 240-0.6\nFL 250-0.61\nFL 260-0.62\nFL 270-0.64\nFL 280-0.65\nFL 290-0.66.\nA pilot will advise if unable to comply with the speed assignment.\nTo aircraft operating beneath Class B airspace or in a VFR corridor designated through Class B airspace: assign a speed not more than 200 knots.\nTo arrival aircraft operating below 10,000 feet:\nTurbojet aircraft:\nAssign a speed not less than 210 knots, except for the aircraft as specified in subparagraph b above, or\nAssign a speed not less than 170 knots when the aircraft is within 20 flying miles of the runway threshold.\nReciprocating and turboprop aircraft:\nAssign a speed not less than 200 knots, or\nAssign a speed not less than 150 knots when the aircraft is within 20 flying miles of the runway threshold.\nTo departures:\nTurbojet aircraft: assign a speed not less than 230 knots.\nReciprocating and turboprop aircraft: assign a speed not less than 150 knots.\nTo helicopters: Assign a speed not less than 60 knots.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-7-2, Methods.\nLower speeds may be assigned when operationally advantageous.\nNOTE-\nA pilot operating at or above 10,000 feet MSL on an assigned speed adjustment greater than 250 knots is expected to comply with 14 CFR section 91.117(a) when cleared below 10,000 feet MSL, within domestic airspace, without notifying ATC. Pilots are expected to comply with the other provisions of 14 CFR section 91.117 without notification.\nSpeed restrictions of 250 knots do not apply to aircraft operating beyond 12 NM from the coastline within the U.S. Flight Information Region, in offshore Class E airspace below 10,000 feet MSL. However, in airspace underlying a Class B airspace area designated for an airport, or in a VFR corridor designated through such a Class B airspace area, pilots are expected to comply with the 200 knot speed limit specified in 14 CFR section 91.117(c). (See 14 CFR sections 91.117(c) and 91.70).\nThe phrases “maintain maximum forward speed\" and “maintain slowest practical speed\" are primarily intended for use when sequencing a group of aircraft.

Radar DeparturesPROCEDURES\nWhen vectoring a departing aircraft on a radar SID, concurrent use of a diverse vector area (DVA) is not permitted.\nWhen the departure route description on a radar SID contains the phrase, “Fly assigned heading,” “as assigned by ATC,” or similar phrases, with a published range of headings in the route description, assign headings or vectors as needed not to exceed those headings in the published range until reaching the MVA/MIA.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-3, Vectors Below Minimum Altitude.\nINITIAL HEADING\nBefore departure, assign the initial heading consistent with either a SID being flown or DVA, if applicable, when a departing aircraft is to be vectored immediately after takeoff. At locations that have a DVA, concurrent use of both a SID and DVA is not permitted.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nFLY RUNWAY HEADING.\nTURN LEFT/RIGHT, HEADING (degrees).\nNOTE-\nTERMINAL. A purpose for the heading is not necessary, since pilots operating in a radar environment associate assigned headings with vectors to their planned route of flight.\nATC assumes responsibility for terrain and obstacle avoidance when IFR aircraft are below the minimum IFR altitude (MVA, MIA, MEA) and are taken off departure/missed approach procedures, or if issued go-around instructions, except after conducting a visual approach. ATC does not assume this responsibility when utilizing a Diverse Vector Area (DVA) or when operating on SIDs with or without a published range of headings in the departure route description.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-2, Departure Clearances.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-3, Vectors Below Minimum Altitude.\nAt locations with both SIDs and DVAs, an amended departure clearance is required to cancel a previously assigned SID and subsequently utilize a DVA or vice versa. The amended clearance must be provided to the pilot in a timely manner so that the pilot may brief the changes in advance of entering the runway.\nIssue an altitude to maintain with the initial heading when the heading will take the aircraft off a departure procedure that contains both a published lateral path to a waypoint and crossing restrictions.\nWhen conducting simultaneous parallel runway departures utilizing RNAV SIDs, advise aircraft of the initial fix/waypoint on the RNAV route.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRNAV to (fix/waypoint), RUNWAY (number), CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.\nEXAMPLE-\n“RNAV to MPASS, Runway Two-Six Left, cleared for takeoff.”\nNOTE-\nTERMINAL.  A purpose for an initial waypoint advisory is not necessary since pilots associate this advisory with the flight path to their planned route of flight. Pilots must immediately advise ATC if a different RNAV SID is entered in the aircraft FMS.\nThe SID transition is not restated as it is contained in the ATC clearance.\nAircraft cleared via RNAV SIDs designed to begin with a vector to the initial waypoint are assigned a heading before departure.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-9, Nonintersecting Converging Runway Operations.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-2, Departure Clearances.\nAIM, Para 5-2-7, Departure Control.\nSUCCESSIVE OR SIMULTANEOUS DEPARTURES\nTERMINAL\nSeparate aircraft departing from the same airport/heliport or adjacent airports/heliports in accordance with the following minima provided radar identification with the aircraft will be established within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end/helipad and courses will diverge by at least the minimum required, as stated below.\nNOTE-\nFAA Order 8260.46, Departure Procedure (DP) Program, and FAA Order 8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Volume 4, establishes guidelines for IFR departure turning procedures which assumes a climb to 400 feet above the departure end of runway (DER) elevation before a turn is commenced. TERPS criteria ensures obstacle clearance with a climb gradient of 200 feet per nautical mile from the DER. “Immediately after departure” is considered to be any turn that provides at least the minimum required divergence that commences no later than 2 miles from the DER.\nConsider known aircraft performance characteristics when applying initial separation to successive departing aircraft.\nWhen one or both of the departure surfaces is a helipad, use the takeoff course of the helicopter as a reference, comparable to the centerline of a runway and the helipad center as the threshold.\nBetween successive departures from the same runway/helipad or parallel runways/helicopter takeoff courses separated by less than 2,500 feet- 1 mile if courses diverge by 15 degrees or more immediately after departure.

(See FIG 5-8-1.)\nNOTE-\nThis procedure does not apply when wake turbulence separation is required.\nBetween simultaneous departures from parallel runways/helicopter takeoff courses, authorize simultaneous takeoffs if the centerlines/takeoff courses are separated by at least 700 feet and less than 2,500 feet, courses diverge by 15 degrees or more, and departures are released in accordance with the release distance stagger stated in TBL 5-8-1 below.\nTBL 5-8-1Departure Release Distances\nDistance to Divergence\n(Measured from the further DER)\nMinimum Centerline Separation\nRelease Distance Stagger\nImmediately\n700\n1000 feet\nNo later than 5 NM\n1020\n2000 feet\nNo later than 8 NM\n1130\n3000 feet\nNo later than 11 NM\n1360\n4000 feet\nNOTE-\nThis procedure does not apply when wake turbulence separation is required.\nFIG 5-8-4Simultaneous Dependent Departures\nBetween simultaneous departures from parallel runways/helicopter takeoff courses, authorize simultaneous takeoffs if the centerlines/takeoff courses are separated by at least 2,500 feet and courses diverge by 10 degrees or more immediately after departure. (See FIG 5-8-5, and FIG 5-8-6.)\nNOTE-\nRNAV SIDs specific to this paragraph are those SIDs constructed with a specific lateral path that begins at the DER.\nFIG 5-8-5Parallel Runway Departures\nFIG 5-8-6Parallel Helicopter Course Departures\nBetween aircraft departing from diverging runways:\nNonintersecting runways. Authorize simultaneous takeoffs if runways diverge by 15 degrees or more. (See FIG 5-8-7.)\nFIG 5-8-7Nonintersecting Runway Departures\nIntersecting runways and/or helicopter takeoff courses which diverge by 15 degrees or more. Authorize takeoff of a succeeding aircraft when the preceding aircraft has passed the point of runway and/or takeoff course intersection. When applicable, apply the procedure in paragraph 3-9-5, Anticipating Separation. (See FIG 5-8-8 and FIG 5-8-9.)\nFIG 5-8-8Intersecting Runway Departures\nFIG 5-8-9Intersecting Helicopter Course Departures\nNOTE-\nThis procedure does not apply when wake turbulence separation is required.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-4, Minima, Subparagraph f.\nDEPARTURE AND ARRIVAL\nTERMINAL. Except as provided in paragraph 5-8-5, Departures and Arrivals on Parallel or Nonintersecting Diverging Runways, separate a departing aircraft from an arriving aircraft on final approach by a minimum of 2 miles if separation will increase to a minimum of 3 miles (5 miles when 40 miles or more from the antenna) within 1 minute after takeoff.\nNOTE-\nThis procedure permits a departing aircraft to be released so long as an arriving aircraft is no closer than 2 miles from the runway at the time. This separation is determined at the time the departing aircraft commences takeoff roll.\nConsider the effect surface conditions, such as ice, snow, and other precipitation, may have on known aircraft performance characteristics, and the influence these conditions may have on the pilot's ability to commence takeoff roll in a timely manner.\nDEPARTURES AND ARRIVALS ON PARALLEL OR NONINTERSECTING DIVERGING RUNWAYS\nTERMINAL. Authorize simultaneous operations between an aircraft departing on a runway and an aircraft on final approach to another parallel or nonintersecting diverging runway if the departure course diverges immediately by at least 30 degrees from the missed approach course until separation is applied and provided one of the following conditions is met:\nNOTE-\nWhen one or both of the takeoff/landing surfaces is a helipad, consider the helicopter takeoff course as the runway centerline and the helipad center as the threshold.\nWhen parallel runway thresholds are even, the runway centerlines are at least 2,500 feet apart. (See FIG 5-8-10 and FIG 5-8-11.)\nFIG 5-8-10Parallel Thresholds are Even\nFIG 5-8-11Parallel Thresholds are Even\nWhen parallel runway thresholds are staggered and:\nThe arriving aircraft is approaching the nearer runway: the centerlines are at least 1,000 feet apart and the landing thresholds are staggered at least 500 feet for each 100 feet less than 2,500 the centerlines are separated.

Radar ArrivalsVECTORS TO FINAL APPROACH COURSE\nExcept as provided in paragraph 7-4-2, Vectors for Visual Approach, vector arriving aircraft to intercept the final approach course:\nAt least 2 miles outside the approach gate unless one of the following exists:\nWhen the reported ceiling is at least 500 feet above the MVA/MIA and the visibility is at least 3 miles (report may be a PIREP if no weather is reported for the airport), aircraft may be vectored to intercept the final approach course closer than 2 miles outside the approach gate but no closer than the approach gate.\nIf specifically requested by the pilot, aircraft may be vectored to intercept the final approach course inside the approach gate but no closer than the final approach fix.\nEXCEPTION. Conditions 1 and 2 above do not apply to RNAV aircraft being vectored for a GPS or RNAV approach.\nProvide a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation between aircraft on opposite base legs unless another form of approved separation is established during turn-on to final approach.\nFor a precision approach, at an altitude not above the glideslope/glidepath or below the minimum glideslope intercept altitude specified on the approach procedure chart.\nFor a nonprecision approach, at an altitude which will allow descent in accordance with the published procedure.\nNOTE-\nA pilot request for an “evaluation approach,” or a “coupled approach,” or use of a similar term, indicates the pilot desires the application of subparagraphs a and b.\nEN ROUTE. The following provisions are required before an aircraft may be vectored to the final approach course:\nThe approach gate and a line (solid or broken), depicting the final approach course starting at or passing through the approach gate and extending away from the airport, be displayed on the radar scope; for a precision approach, the line length must extend at least the maximum range of the localizer; for a nonprecision approach, the line length must extend at least 10 NM outside the approach gate; and\nThe maximum range selected on the radar display is 150 NM; or\nAn adjacent radar display is set at 125 NM or less, configured for the approach in use, and is utilized for the vector to the final approach course.\nIf unable to comply with subparagraphs 1, 2, or 3 above, issue the clearance in accordance with paragraph 4-8-1, Approach Clearance.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-1, Approach Clearance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-2, Final Approach Course Interception.\nFINAL APPROACH COURSE INTERCEPTION\nAssign headings that will permit final approach course interception on a track that does not exceed the interception angles specified in TBL 5-9-1.\nTBL 5-9-1Approach Course Interception Angle\nDistance from interception point to approach gate\nMaximum interception angle\nLess than 2 miles or triple simultaneous approaches in use\n20 degrees\n2 miles or more\n30 degrees\n(45 degrees for helicopters)\nIf deviations from the final approach course are observed after initial course interception, apply the following:\nOutside the approach gate: apply procedures in accordance with subparagraph a, if necessary, vector the aircraft for another approach.\nInside the approach gate: inform the pilot of the aircraft's position and ask intentions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Ident) (distance) MILE(S) FROM THE AIRPORT, (distance) MILE(S) RIGHT/LEFT OF COURSE, SAY INTENTIONS.\nNOTE-\nThe intent is to provide for a track course intercept angle judged by the controller to be no greater than specified by this procedure.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 9, Radar Arrivals, and Section 10, Radar Approaches- Terminal.\nEN ROUTE. When using a radar scope range above 125 NM, the controller must solicit and receive a pilot report that the aircraft is established on the final approach course. If the pilot has not reported established by the final approach gate, inform the pilot of his/her observed position and ask intentions.\nNOTE-\nIt may be difficult to accurately determine small distances when using very large range settings.\nVECTORS ACROSS FINAL APPROACH COURSE\nInform the aircraft whenever a vector will take it across the final approach course and state the reason for such action.\nNOTE-\nIn the event you are unable to so inform the aircraft, the pilot is not expected to turn inbound on the final approach course unless approach clearance has been issued.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT VECTORS ACROSS FINAL FOR (purpose).\nEXAMPLE-\n“EXPECT VECTORS ACROSS FINAL FOR SPACING.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-2, Final Approach Course Interception.\nARRIVAL INSTRUCTIONS\nIssue all of the following to an aircraft before it reaches the approach gate:\nPosition relative to a fix on the final approach course. If none is portrayed on the radar display or if none is prescribed in the procedure, issue position information relative to the navigation aid which provides final approach guidance or relative to the airport.\nVector to intercept the final approach course if required.\nApproach clearance except when conducting a radar approach. Issue approach clearance only after the aircraft is:\nEstablished on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure, or see FIG 5-9-1 Example 1.\nFIG 5-9-1Arrival Instructions\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 1 was vectored to the final approach course but clearance was withheld. It is now at 4,000 feet and established on a segment of the instrument approach procedure. “Seven miles from X‐RAY. Cleared I-L-S runway three six approach.” (See FIG 5-9-1.)\nAircraft 2 is being vectored to a published segment of the final approach course, 4 miles from LIMA at 2,000 feet. The MVA for this area is 2,000 feet. “Four miles from LIMA. Turn right heading three four zero. Maintain two thousand until established on the localizer. Cleared I-L-S runway three six approach.” (See FIG 5-9-1.)\nAircraft 3 is being vectored to intercept the final approach course beyond the approach segments, 5 miles from Alpha at 5,000 feet. the MVA for this area is 4,000 feet. “Five miles from Alpha. Turn right heading three three zero. Cross Alpha at or above four thousand. Cleared I-L-S runway three six approach.” (See FIG 5-9-1.)\nAircraft 4 is established on the final approach course beyond the approach segments, 8 miles from Alpha at 6,000 feet. The MVA for this area is 4,000 feet. “Eight miles from Alpha. Cross Alpha at or above four thousand. Cleared I-L-S runway three six approach.” (See FIG 5-9-1.)\nAssigned an altitude to maintain until the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure.\nFIG 5-9-2Arrival Instructions\nEXAMPLE-\nThe aircraft is being vectored to the intermediate fix FORRE for an RNAV approach. “Seven miles from FORRE, cleared direct FORRE, cross FORRE at or above four thousand, cleared RNAV runway one eight approach.”\nNOTE-\nThe altitude assigned must assure IFR obstruction clearance from the point at which the approach clearance is issued until established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure.\nIf the altitude assignment is VFR‐on‐top, it is conceivable that the pilot may elect to remain high until arrival over the final approach fix which may require the pilot to circle to descend so as to cross the final approach fix at an altitude that would permit landing.\nAircraft being vectored to the intermediate fix in FIG 5-9-2 must meet all the provisions described in subparagraph 4-8-1h2.\nInstructions to do one of the following:\nNOTE-\nThe principal purpose of this paragraph is to ensure that frequency changes are made prior to passing the final approach fix. However, at times it will be desirable to retain an aircraft on the approach control frequency to provide a single‐frequency approach or other radar services. When this occurs, it will be necessary to relay tower clearances or instructions to preclude changing frequencies prior to landing or approach termination.\nMonitor local control frequency, reporting to the tower when over the approach fix.\nContact the tower on local control frequency.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-8, Communications Release.\nContact the final controller on the appropriate frequency if radar service will be provided on final on a different frequency.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-10-8, Final Controller Changeover.\nWhen radar is used to establish the final approach fix, inform the pilot that after being advised that he/she is over the fix he/she is to contact the tower on local control frequency.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Three miles from final approach fix. Turn left heading zero one zero. Maintain two thousand until established on the localizer. Cleared I-L-S runway three six approach. I will advise when over the fix.”\n“Over final approach fix. Contact tower one one eight point one.”\nNOTE-\nARSR may be used for establishment of initial approach and intermediate approach fixes only. ASR must be used to establish the final approach fix.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-2, Final Approach Course Interception.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-7, Simultaneous Independent Approaches- Dual & Triple.\nWhere a Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) has been established to support instrument approaches, inform the aircraft of its position relative to the appropriate IAF and issue the approach clearance. (See FIG 5-9-3.)\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft 1: The aircraft is in the straight in area of the TAA. “Seven miles from CENTR, Cleared R-NAV Runway One Eight Approach.”\nAircraft 2: The aircraft is in the left base area of the TAA. “One five miles from LEFTT, Cleared R-NAV Runway One Eight Approach.”\nAircraft 3: The aircraft is in the right base area of the\nTAA. “Four miles from RIGHT, Cleared R-NAV Runway One Eight Approach.”\nFIG 5-9-3Basic “T” Design\nAPPROACH SEPARATION RESPONSIBILITY\nThe radar controller performing the approach control function is responsible for separation of radar arrivals unless visual separation is provided by the tower, or a letter of agreement/facility directive authorizes otherwise. Radar final controllers ensure that established separation is maintained between aircraft under their control and other aircraft established on the same final approach course.\nNOTE-\nThe radar controller may be a controller in an ARTCC, a terminal facility, or a tower controller when authorized to perform the approach control function in a terminal area.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-19, Wake Turbulence.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Section 5, Radar Separation, Para 5-5-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-4, Minima.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-16, Authorization for Separation Services by Towers.\nWhen timed approaches are being conducted, the radar controller must maintain the radar separation specified in paragraph 6-7-5, Interval Minima, until the aircraft is observed to have passed the final approach fix inbound (nonprecision approaches) or the OM or the fix used in lieu of the outer marker (precision approaches) and is within 5 miles of the runway on the final approach course or until visual separation can be provided by the tower.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-6, Receiving Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-2, Final Approach Course Interception.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-6, Simultaneous Dependent Approaches.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-7-2, Approach Sequence.\nSIMULTANEOUS DEPENDENT APPROACHES\nTERMINAL\nApply the following minimum separation when conducting simultaneous dependent approaches:\nProvide a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical or a minimum of 3 miles radar separation between aircraft during turn on.\nProvide a minimum of 1 mile radar separation diagonally between successive aircraft on adjacent final approach courses when runway centerlines are at least 2,500 feet but no more than 3,600 feet apart.\nFIG 5-9-4Simultaneous Dependent Approaches\nEXAMPLE-\nIn FIG 5-9-4, Aircraft 2 is 1.0 mile from Aircraft 1.

Aircraft 3 is a small aircraft and is 6 miles from Aircraft 1. *The resultant separation between Aircraft 2 and 3 is at least 4.7 miles.\nProvide the minimum approved radar separation between aircraft on the same final approach course.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Section 5, Radar Separation, Para 5-5-4, Minima.\nThe following conditions are required when applying the minimum radar separation on adjacent final approach courses allowed in subparagraph a:\nNOTE-\nEstablished on RNP (EoR) operations are not authorized in conjunction with simultaneous dependent approaches.\nSimultaneous dependent approaches may only be conducted where instrument approach charts specifically authorize simultaneous approaches.\nApply this separation standard only after aircraft are established on the parallel final approach course.\nStraight‐in landings will be made.\nMissed approach procedures do not conflict.\nAircraft are informed that approaches to both runways are in use. This information may be provided through the ATIS.\nApproach control must have the interphone capability of communicating directly with the local controller at locations where separation responsibility has not been delegated to the tower.\nNOTE-\nThe interphone capability is an integral part of this procedure when approach control has the sole separation responsibility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-5, Approach Separation Responsibility.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-16, Authorization for Separation Services by Towers.\nConsideration should be given to known factors that may in any way affect the safety of the instrument approach phase of flight, such as surface wind direction and velocity, wind shear alerts/reports, severe weather activity, etc. Closely monitor weather activity that could impact the final approach course.

The NTZ begins prior to the point where adjacent inbound aircraft first lose vertical separation and extends to a point coincident with the location of the offset approach MAP. The primary responsibility for navigation on the final approach course rests with the pilot. Control instructions and information are issued only to ensure separation between aircraft and to prevent aircraft from penetrating the NTZ.\nNOTE-\nWhere RCLS is ≤3400 feet, the normal operating zone (NOZ) is constant at 700 feet; and for RCLS ≥3400 feet, the no transgression zone (NTZ) remains constant at 2000 feet.\nMonitor all approaches regardless of weather.

Facility directives must define the responsibility for providing the minimum applicable longitudinal separation between aircraft on the same final approach course and the minimum applicable longitudinal separation between the trailing offset aircraft of a leading SOIA pair and the lead straight in aircraft in the subsequent SOIA pair when the parallel runways have centerlines separated by less than 2,500 feet.\nNOTE-\nThe aircraft is considered the center of the digitized target for that aircraft for the purposes of ensuring an aircraft does not penetrate the NTZ.\nThe following procedures must be used by the final monitor controllers:\nProvide position information to an aircraft that is (left/right) of the depicted final approach course centerline, and in your judgment is continuing on a track that may penetrate the NTZ.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Aircraft call sign) I SHOW YOU (left/right) OF THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE.\nInstruct the aircraft to return immediately to the correct final approach course when aircraft are observed to overshoot the turn-on or continue on a track which will penetrate the NTZ.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nYOU HAVE CROSSED THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE. TURN (left/right) IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN TO FINAL APPROACH COURSE.\nor\nTURN (left/right) AND RETURN TO THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE.\nInstruct aircraft on the adjacent final approach course to alter course to avoid the deviating aircraft when an aircraft is observed penetrating or in your judgment will penetrate the NTZ.\nNOTE-\nAn instruction that may include a descent to avoid the deviating aircraft should only be used when there is no other reasonable option available to the controller. In such a case, the descent must not put the aircraft below the MVA.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTRAFFIC ALERT, (call sign), TURN (left/right) IMMEDIATELY HEADING (DEGREES), CLIMB AND MAINTAIN (altitude).\nTerminate radar monitoring when one of the following occurs:\nThe lead straight in aircraft passes the end of the NTZ nearest the runway threshold.\nThe trailing offset aircraft passes the end of the NTZ nearest the runway threshold and has reported the lead straight in aircraft in sight.\nThe aircraft begins the visual segment of the approach.\nDo not inform the aircraft when radar monitoring is terminated.\nAdvise the pilot of the trailing offset aircraft of traffic on the adjacent lead straight-in approach course, if that traffic will be a factor in the visual segment of the approach. The provisions of paragraph 7-2-1, Visual Separation, subparagraph a1, concerning visual separation between aircraft being provided by the tower must not be applied to aircraft conducting SOIAs.\nNOTE-\nOnce advised, the pilot is authorized to continue past the offset approach MAP if all of the following conditions are met: The pilot has the straight-in approach traffic in sight and expects the traffic to remain in sight; the pilot advises ATC that the traffic is in sight; and the pilot has the runway environment in sight. Otherwise, it is the pilot's responsibility to execute a missed approach at the offset approach MAP.\nEnsure that the trailing offset aircraft is positioned to facilitate the flight crew's ability to see the lead straight in traffic from the nominal clear-of-clouds point to the offset approach MAP so that the flight crew can remain separated from that traffic visually from the offset approach MAP to the runway threshold.\nNOTE-\nAfter accepting a clearance for an offset PRM approach, pilots must remain on the offset approach course until passing the offset approach MAP prior to alignment with the runway centerline.  Between the offset approach MAP and the runway threshold, the pilot of the offset approach aircraft assumes visual separation responsibility from the aircraft on the straight-in approach, which means maneuvering the aircraft as necessary to avoid the straight in approach traffic until landing, and providing wake turbulence avoidance, if necessary.\nIn the visual segment between the offset approach MAP and the runway threshold, if the pilot of the trailing offset aircraft loses visual contact with the lead straight-in traffic, the pilot must advise ATC as soon as practical and follow the published missed approach procedure. If necessary, issue alternate missed approach instructions.\nWake turbulence requirements between aircraft on adjacent final approach courses inside the offset approach MAP are as follows (standard in-trail wake separation must be applied between aircraft on the same approach course):\nWhen runways are at least 2,500 feet apart, there are no wake turbulence requirements between aircraft on adjacent final approach courses.\nFor runways less than 2,500 feet apart, whenever the ceiling is greater than or equal to 500 feet above the MVA, wake vortex spacing between aircraft on adjacent final approach courses need not be applied.\nFor runways less than 2,500 feet apart, whenever the ceiling is less than 500 feet above the MVA, wake vortex spacing between aircraft on adjacent final approach courses, as described in paragraph 5-5-4, Minima, must be applied unless acceptable mitigating techniques and operational procedures have been documented and verified by an AFS safety assessment and authorized by the Director, Strategic Operations, AJT-1. The wake turbulence mitigation techniques employed will be based on each airport's specific runway geometry and meteorological conditions and implemented through local facility directives.\nIssue all applicable wake turbulence advisories.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 8260.49, Para 13.0, Wake Turbulence Requirements.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-4-6, Simultaneous Independent Approaches.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-20, Wake Turbulence Cautionary Advisories.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-4, Minima.\nConsideration should be given to known factors that may in any way affect the safety of the instrument approach phase of flight when conducting SOIA to parallel runways.

This information may be provided through the ATIS.\nClear an aircraft to descend to the appropriate glideslope/glidepath intercept altitude soon enough to provide a period of level flight to dissipate excess speed. Provide at least 1 mile of straight flight prior to the final approach course intercept.\nNOTE-\nNot applicable to approaches with RF legs.\nSeparate final and local controllers are required for each final. Aircraft on the final must be on the appropriate final controller frequency for that runway.\nTransfer of communication to the tower controller's frequency must be specified in a facility directive and/or Letter of Agreement.\nThe following procedures must be used by the final approach controllers:\nNOTE-\nThere is no requirement for establishment of a NTZ.\nInstruct the aircraft to return to the correct final approach course when that aircraft is observed to overshoot the turn-on or continue on a track which deviates from the final approach course in the direction of the adjacent approach course.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nYOU HAVE CROSSED THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE.

Radar Approaches- TerminalAPPLICATION\nProvide radar approaches in accordance with standard or special instrument approach procedures.\nA radar approach may be given to any aircraft upon request and may be offered to aircraft in distress regardless of weather conditions or to expedite traffic.\nNOTE-\nAcceptance of a radar approach by a pilot does not waive the prescribed weather minima for the airport or for the particular aircraft operator concerned. The pilot is responsible for determining if the approach and landing are authorized under the existing weather minima.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-2, Final Approach Course Interception.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-12-10, Elevation Failure.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-1a, Approach Clearance.\nP/CG Term − EFVS.\nAPPROACH INFORMATION\nIssue the following information to an aircraft that will conduct a radar approach. Current approach information contained in the ATIS broadcast may be omitted if the pilot states the appropriate ATIS broadcast code. All items listed below, except for subparagraph 3 may be omitted after the first approach if repeated approaches are made and no change has occurred. Transmissions with aircraft in this phase of the approach should occur approximately every minute.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-10, Approach Information.\nAltimeter setting.\nIf available, ceiling and visibility if the ceiling at the airport of intended landing is reported below 1,000 feet or below the highest circling minimum, whichever is greater, or if the visibility is less than 3 miles. Advise pilots when weather information is available via the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS)/Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) and, if requested, issue the appropriate frequency.\nNOTE-\nAutomated weather observing systems may be set to provide one minute updates. This one minute data may be useful to the pilot for possible weather trends. Controllers provide service based solely on official weather, i.e., hourly and special observations.\nIssue any known changes classified as special weather observations as soon as possible. Special weather observations need not be issued after they are included in the ATIS broadcast and the pilot states the appropriate ATIS broadcast code.\nPertinent information on known airport conditions if they are considered necessary to the safe operation of the aircraft concerned.\nLost communication procedures as specified in paragraph 5-10-4, Lost Communications.\nBefore starting final approach:\nNOTE-\nASR approach procedures may be prescribed for specific runways, for an airport/heliport, and for helicopters only to a “point‐in‐space,“ i.e., a MAP from which a helicopter must be able to proceed to the landing area by visual reference to a prescribed surface route.\nOccasionally, helicopter PAR approaches are available to runways where conventional PAR approaches have been established. In those instances where the two PAR approaches serve the same runway, the helicopter approach will have a steeper glide slope and a lower decision height. By the controllers designating the approach to be flown, the helicopter pilot understands which of the two approaches he/she has been vectored for and which set of minima apply.\nInform the aircraft of the type of approach, runway, airport, heliport, or other point, as appropriate, to which the approach will be made.

All military facilities will issue specific lost communications instructions to civil aircraft when required.\nIf lost communications instructions will require the aircraft to fly on an unpublished route, issue an appropriate altitude to the pilot. If the lost communications instructions are the same for both pattern and final, the pattern/vector controller must issue both. Advise the pilot that if radio communications are lost for a specified time interval (not more than 1 minute) on vector to final approach, 15 seconds on a surveillance final approach, or 5 seconds on a PAR final approach to:\nAttempt contact on a secondary or a tower frequency.\nProceed in accordance with visual flight rules if possible.\nProceed with an approved nonradar approach, or execute the specific lost communications procedure for the radar approach being used.\nNOTE-\nThe approved procedures are those published on the FAA Forms 8260 or applicable military document.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nIF NO TRANSMISSIONS ARE RECEIVED FOR (time interval) IN THE PATTERN OR FIVE/FIFTEEN SECONDS ON FINAL APPROACH, ATTEMPT CONTACT ON (frequency), AND\nif the possibility exists,\nPROCEED VFR.

Automation- En RouteCONFLICT ALERT (CA) AND MODE C INTRUDER (MCI) ALERT\nWhen a CA or MCI alert is displayed, evaluate the reason for the alert without delay and take appropriate action.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nIf another controller is involved in the alert, initiate coordination to ensure an effective course of action. Coordination is not required when immediate action is dictated.\nSuppressing/Inhibiting CA/MCI alert.\nThe controller may suppress the display of a CA/MCI alert from a control position with the application of one of the following suppress/inhibit computer functions:\nThe Conflict Suppress (CO) function may be used to suppress the CA/MCI display between specific aircraft for a specific alert.\nNOTE-\nSee NAS-MD-678 for the EARTS conflict suppress message.\nThe Group Suppression (SG) function must be applied exclusively to inhibit the displaying of alerts among military aircraft engaged in special military operations where standard en route separation criteria does not apply.\nNOTE-\nSpecial military operations where the SG function would typically apply involve those activities where military aircraft routinely operate in proximities to each other that are less than standard en route separation criteria; i.e., air refueling operations, ADC practice intercept operations, etc.\nThe computer entry of a message suppressing a CA/MCI alert constitutes acknowledgment for the alert and signifies that appropriate action has or will be taken.\nThe CA/MCI alert may not be suppressed or inhibited at or for another control position without being coordinated.\nEN ROUTE MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE WARNING (E‐MSAW)\nWhen an E‐MSAW alert is displayed, immediately analyze the situation and take the appropriate action to resolve the alert.\nNOTE-\nCaution should be exercised when issuing a clearance to an aircraft in reaction to an E‐MSAW alert to ensure that adjacent MIA areas are not a factor.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nThe controller may suppress the display of an E‐MSAW alert from his/her control position with the application of one of the following suppress/inhibit computer functions:\nThe specific alert suppression message may be used to inhibit the E‐MSAW alerting display on a single flight for a specific alert.\nThe indefinite alert suppression message must be used exclusively to inhibit the display of E‐MSAW alerts on aircraft known to be flying at an altitude that will activate the alert feature of one or more MIA areas within an ARTCC.\nNOTE-\nThe indefinite alert suppression message will remain in effect for the duration of the referenced flight's active status within the ARTCC unless modified by controller action.\nThe indefinite alert suppression message would typically apply to military flights with clearance to fly low‐level type routes that routinely require altitudes below established minimum IFR altitudes.\nThe computer entry of a message suppressing or inhibiting E‐MSAW alerts constitutes acknowledgment for the alert and indicates that appropriate action has or will be taken to resolve the situation.\nCOMPUTER ENTRY OF FLIGHT PLAN INFORMATION\nAltitude\nThe altitude field(s) of the data block must always reflect the current status of the aircraft unless otherwise specified in an appropriate facility directive.\nUnless otherwise specified in a facility directive or letter of agreement, do not modify assigned or interim altitude information prior to establishing communication with an aircraft that is outside your area of  jurisdiction unless verbal coordination identifying who will modify the data block has been accomplished.\nNOTE-\nA local interim altitude (LIA) can be used as a means of recording interfacility coordination.\nConflict probe in EDST does not probe for the LIA.\nWhenever an aircraft is cleared to maintain an altitude different from that in the flight plan database, enter into the computer one of the following:\nThe new assigned altitude if the aircraft will (climb or descend to and) maintain the new altitude, or\nAn interim altitude if the aircraft will (climb or descend to and) maintain the new altitude for a short period of time and subsequently be recleared to the altitude in the flight plan database or a new altitude or a new interim altitude, or\nERAM\nA procedure altitude if the aircraft is cleared to vertically navigate (VNAV) on a SID/STAR with published restrictions, or\nWhere appropriate for interfacility handoffs, an LIA when the assigned altitude differs from the coordinated altitude unless verbally coordinated or specified in a letter of agreement or facility directive.\nNOTE-\nA facility directive may be published, in accordance with JO 7210.3, paragraph 8-2-7, Waiver to Interim Altitude Requirements, deleting the interim altitude computer entry requirements of subparagraph 3.\nFlight Plan Route Data\nThis information must not be modified outside of the controller's area of jurisdiction unless verbally coordinated or specified in a Letter of Agreement or Facility Directive.\nENTRY OF REPORTED ALTITUDE\nWhenever Mode C altitude information is either not available or is unreliable, enter reported altitudes into the computer as follows:\nNOTE-\nAltitude updates are required to assure maximum accuracy in applying slant range correction formulas.\nWhen an aircraft reaches the assigned altitude.\nWhen an aircraft at an assigned altitude is issued a clearance to climb or descend.\nA minimum of each 10,000 feet during climb to or descent from FL 180 and above.\nSELECTED ALTITUDE LIMITS\nThe display of Mode C targets and limited data blocks is necessary for application of Merging Target Procedures. Sectors must ensure the display of Mode C targets and data blocks by entering appropriate altitude limits and display filters to include, as a minimum, the altitude stratum of the sector plus:\n1,200 feet above the highest and below the lowest altitude or flight level of the sector where 1,000 feet vertical separation is applicable; and\n2,200 feet above the highest and below the lowest flight level of the sector where 2,000 feet vertical separation is applicable.\nNOTE-\nThe data block, for purposes of this paragraph, must contain the Mode C altitude and call sign or beacon code at a minimum.\nException to these requirements may be authorized for specific altitudes in certain ARTCC sectors if defined in appropriate facility directives and approved by the respective service area operations directorate.\nSECTOR ELIGIBILITY\nThe use of the OK function is allowed to override sector eligibility only when one of the following conditions is met:\nPrior coordination is effected.\nThe flight is within the control jurisdiction of the sector.\nCOAST TRACKS\nDo not use coast tracks in the application of either radar or nonradar separation criteria.\nCONTROLLER INITIATED COAST TRACKS\nInitiate coast tracks only in Flight Plan Aided Tracking (FLAT) mode, except “free” coast tracking may be used as a reminder that aircraft without corresponding computer‐stored flight plan information are under your control.\nNOTE-\nTo ensure tracks are started in FLAT mode, perform a start track function at the aircraft's most current reported position, then immediately “force” the track into coast tracking by performing another start function with “CT” option in field 64. Making amendments to the stored route with trackball entry when the aircraft is rerouted, and repositioning the data block to coincide with the aircraft's position reports are methods of maintaining a coast track in FLAT mode.\nPrior to initiating a coast track, ensure that a departure message or progress report corresponding with the aircraft's current position is entered into the computer.\nAs soon as practicable after the aircraft is in radar surveillance, initiate action to cause radar tracking to begin on the aircraft.\nERAM COMPUTER ENTRY OF HOLD INFORMATION\nWhen an aircraft is issued holding instructions, the delay is ATC initiated, and the EFC is other than “no delay expected:\"\nEnter a hold message.\nMaintain a paired track.\nEnter an EFC time via a hold message, the Hold Data Menu, or the Hold View.\nEnter non-published holding instructions via a hold message or the Hold Data Menu.\nNOTE-\nThe ERAM hold message allows automatic calculation and reporting of aggregate delays.\nUnless otherwise specified in a facility directive, verbally coordinate non-published holding instructions when handing off an aircraft in hold status to another ERAM sector.\nAn EFC time entered into the Hold Data Menu, Hold View, or the hold message constitutes coordination of the EFC between ERAM sectors.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 8-2-9, ERAM Hold Information Facility Directive Requirements.\nERAM VISUAL INDICATOR OF SPECIAL ACTIVITY AIRSPACE (SAA) STATUS\nSector controllers must ensure the situation display's Airspace Status View/SAA Filter View accurately reflects the status of adapted Special Activity Airspace (SAA) that impact their area of control responsibility. When “SAA DOWN” is displayed in the Outage View, manually create visual indicators on the situation display to reflect changes to airspace status.\nNOTE-\nThe “SAA DOWN” message in the Outage View means that SAA status is no longer being updated. The status of each adapted SAA at the time of the failure, whether “on” or “off”, will continue to be displayed. Status changes will not be automatically updated in the display until the outage is resolved.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS)-TerminalAPPLICATION\nSTARS may be used for identifying aircraft assigned a discrete beacon code, maintaining identity of targets, and performing handoffs of these targets between controllers. All procedures for the terminal domain related to air traffic control services using STARS apply to the FUSION target.\nRESPONSIBILITY\nThis equipment does not relieve the controller of the responsibility to ensure proper identification, maintenance of identity, handoff of the correct target associated with the alphanumeric data, and separation of aircraft.\nFUNCTIONAL USE\nIn addition to other uses specified herein, terminal automation may be used for the following functions:\nTracking.\nTagging.\nHandoff.\nAltitude information.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-21, Altitude Filters.\nCoordination.\nGround speed.\nIdentification.\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\nUse terminal automation systems as follows:\nNOTE-\nLocally developed procedures, operating instructions, and training material are required because of differences in equipment capability. Such locally developed procedures must be supplemental to those contained in this section and must be designed to make maximum use of the STARS equipment.\nInform all appropriate positions before terminating or reinstating use of the terminal automation system at a control position. When terminating the use of terminal automation systems, all pertinent flight data of that position must be transferred or terminated.\nInform other interfaced facilities of scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns.\nInitiate a track/tag on all aircraft to the maximum extent possible. As a minimum, aircraft identification should be entered, and automated handoff functions should be used.\nAssigned altitude, if displayed, must be kept current at all times. Climb and descent arrows, where available, must be used to indicate other than level flight.\nWhen operating in FUSION mode, the assigned or pilot reported altitude must be displayed and kept current when the aircraft is in level flight.\nThe automatic altitude readout of an aircraft under another controller's jurisdiction may be used for vertical separation purposes without verbal coordination provided:\nOperation is conducted using single-site radar coverage or when operating in FUSION mode.\nPrearranged coordination procedures are contained in a facility directive in accordance with paragraph 5-4-9, Prearranged Coordination, and FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 3-6-7, Prearranged Coordination.\nDo not use Mode C to effect vertical separation within a Mosaic radar configuration.\nINFORMATION DISPLAYED\nTwo‐letter ICAO designators or three‐letter designators, as appropriate, must be used unless program limitations dictate the use of a single letter alpha prefix.\nUse of the inhibit/select functions to remove displayed information no longer required must be in accordance with local directives, which should ensure maximum required use of the equipment.\nInformation displayed must be in accordance with national orders and specified in local directives.\nDuring outages of the ASR that supports an ASDE system where MLAT is inoperative or is not present, the tower position(s) responsible for aircraft on approach to the airport must enable the ADS-B indicator on the tower display workstation(s) (TDW(s)).\nNOTE-\nThe ADS-B indicator will only display if the TDW is operating in Fused Display Mode.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nCA/MCI\nWhen a CA or MCI alert is displayed, evaluate the reason for the alert without delay and take appropriate action.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nIf another controller is involved in the alert, initiate coordination to ensure an effective course of action. Coordination is not required when immediate action is dictated.\nSuppressing/Inhibiting CA/MCI alert.\nThe suppress function may be used to suppress the display of a specific CA/MCI alert.\nThe inhibit function must only be used to inhibit the display of CA for aircraft routinely engaged in operations where approved separation criteria do not apply.\nNOTE-\nExamples of operations where approved separation criteria do not apply are ADC practice intercept operations and air shows.\nComputer entry of a message suppressing a CA/MCI alert constitutes acknowledgment for the alert and signifies that appropriate action has or will be taken.\nCA/MCI alert may not be suppressed or inhibited at or for another control position without being coordinated.\nINHIBITING MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE WARNING (MSAW)\nInhibit MSAW processing of VFR aircraft and aircraft that cancel instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plans unless the pilot specifically requests otherwise.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-7, VFR Aircraft in Weather Difficulty.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-8, Radar Assistance to VFR Aircraft in Weather Difficulty.\nA low altitude alert may be suppressed from the control position. Computer entry of the suppress message constitutes an acknowledgment for the alert and indicates that appropriate action has or will be taken.\nTRACK SUSPEND FUNCTION\nUse the track suspend function only when data block overlap in holding patterns or in proximity of the final approach create an unworkable situation. If necessary to suspend tracks, those which are not displaying automatic altitude readouts must be suspended. If the condition still exists, those displaying automatic altitude readouts may then be suspended.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Lateral SeparationSEPARATION METHODS\nSeparate aircraft by one of the following methods:\nClear aircraft on different airways or routes whose widths or protected airspace do not overlap.\nClear aircraft below 18,000 to proceed to and report over or hold at different geographical locations determined visually or by reference to NAVAIDs.\nClear aircraft to hold over different fixes whose holding pattern airspace areas do not overlap each other or other airspace to be protected.\nClear departing aircraft to fly specified headings which diverge by at least 45 degrees.\nMINIMA ON DIVERGING RADIALS\nConsider separation to exist between aircraft:\nEstablished on radials of the same NAVAID that diverge by at least 15 degrees when either aircraft is clear of the airspace to be protected for the other aircraft.\nWith non-VOR/DME based navigational equipment established on tracks of the same waypoint that diverge by at least 15 degrees when either aircraft is clear of the airspace to be protected for the other aircraft.\nFIG 6-5-1Minima on Diverging Radials\nNOTE-\nThe procedure may be applied to converging as well as diverging aircraft. (See FIG 6-5-1.) The aircraft depicted 6 miles from the NAVAID/waypoint would require vertical separation until reaching the 6-mile point. Reversing direction, the same aircraft would require vertical separation before passing the 6-mile point. Due to the nature of GPS equipment, issue crossing restrictions in reference to the next waypoint, since the pilot receives tracking “to” data rather than tracking “from” the last waypoint.\nUse TBL 6-5-1 and TBL 6-5-2 to determine the distance required for various divergence angles to clear the airspace to be protected. For divergence that falls between two values, use the lesser divergence value to obtain the distance.\nTBL 6-5-1Non-DME Divergence\nDistance Minima\nDivergence (Degrees)\nDistance (NM)\n15\n16\n20\n12\n25\n10\n30\n8\n35\n7\n45\n6\n55\n5\n90\n4\nNOTE: This table is for non-DME application only.\nTBL 6-5-2Divergence\nDistance Minima\nDivergence (Degrees)\nDistance (NM)\nBelow FL 180\nFL 180 through FL 450\n15\n17\n18\n20\n13\n15\n25\n11\n13\n30\n9\n11\n35\n8\n11\n45\n7\n11\n55\n6\n11\n90\n5\n11\nNOTE: This table is for DME application and compensates for DME slant‐range error.\nNOTE-\nFor altitudes of 3,000 feet or less above the elevation of the NAVAID, DME slant‐range error is negligible and the values in TBL 6-5-1 may be used.\nDME ARC MINIMA\nApply lateral DME separation by requiring aircraft using DME to fly an arc about a NAVAID at a specified distance using the following minima: (See FIG 6-5-2.)\nFIG 6-5-2DME Arc Minima\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-5-2, NAVAID Terms.\nBetween different arcs about a NAVAID regardless of direction of flight:\nAt 35 miles or less from the NAVAID- 10 miles.\nMore than 35 miles from the NAVAID- 20 miles.\nBetween an arc about a NAVAID and other airspace to be protected: (See FIG 6-5-3.)\nFIG 6-5-3DME Arc Minima\nNOTE-\nThe other airspace to be protected may be a MOA, a holding pattern, airway or route, ATCAA, Warning Area, Restricted Area, Prohibited Area, etc.\nAt 35 miles or less from the NAVAID- 5 miles.\nMore than 35 miles from the NAVAID- 10 miles.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nVIA (number of miles) MILE ARC (direction) OF (name of DME/NAVAID).\nMINIMA ALONG OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED AIRWAYS OR ROUTES\nProtect airspace along other than established airways or routes as follows: (See FIG 6-5-4.)\nFIG 6-5-4Minima Along Other Than Established Airways or Routes\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - AIRWAY.\nP/CG Term - ROUTE.\nDirect courses and course changes of 15 degrees or less:\nVia NAVAIDs or radials FL 600 and below- 4 miles on each side of the route to a point 51 miles from the NAVAID, then increasing in width on a 4 1/2 degree angle to a width of 10 miles on each side of the route at a distance of 130 miles from the NAVAID.\nVia degree‐distance fixes for aircraft authorized under paragraph 4-4-3, Degree-Distance Route Definition for Military Operations.\nBelow FL 180- 4 miles on each side of the route.\nFL 180 to FL 600 inclusive- 10 miles on each side of the route.\nVia degree‐distance fixes for RNAV flights above FL 450- 10 miles on each side of the route.\nNOTE-\nExcept for GNSS-equipped aircraft /G, /L, /S, and /V, not on a random impromptu route, paragraph 5-5-1, Application, requires radar separation be provided to RNAV aircraft operating at and below FL450 on Q routes or random RNAV routes, excluding oceanic airspace.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-4-2, Route Structure Transitions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-1, Application.\nP/CG Term - GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (GNSS)[ICAO].\nGNSS-equipped RNAV aircraft provided nonradar separation on random RNAV routes must be cleared via or reported to be established on point-to-point route segments.\nThe points must be published NAVAIDs, waypoints, fixes, or airports recallable from the aircraft's navigation database. The points must be displayed on controller video maps or depicted on the controller chart displayed at the control position. The maximum distance between points must not exceed 500 miles.\nProtect 4 miles either side of the route centerline.\nAssigned altitudes must be at or above the highest MIA along the projected route segment being flown, including the protected airspace of that route segment.\nEXAMPLE-\nA pilot has filed a point-to-point route from XYZ to ABC at 13,000 feet. Departure procedures from the originating airport place the aircraft a significant distance from XYZ; however, the aircraft can establish itself along the route segment from XYZ to ABC. Ascertain when the pilot is established on the point-to-point route segment and at an altitude that meets or exceeds the highest MVA/MIA projected along the route of flight, then issue a clearance. “Verify when you are established on the XYZ to ABC route segment at or above 6,000 feet.”\nWhen the GNSS aircraft is being provided radar service and is transitioning to nonradar airspace, provide clearance direct to the named point in nonradar airspace in accordance with subparagraphs a4(a) through (c).\nIf transitioning between two random point-to-point routes, GNSS-equipped aircraft being provided nonradar separation may be cleared via an impromptu route when the following conditions are met:\nThe impromptu route segment must not exceed the distance to the nearest available recallable fix/waypoint consistent with the direction of flight; and\nAssigned altitudes must be at or above the highest MIA along the projected route segment being flown; and\nAircraft conducting the impromptu route must be separated vertically from other aircraft until established on the new point‐to‐point route.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-4-1, Route Use.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-4-2, Route Structure Transitions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-1, Application.\nWhen course change is 16 degrees through 90 degrees, protect the airspace on the overflown side beginning at the point where the course changes as follows: (See FIG 6-5-5.)\nFIG 6-5-5Overflown Side Minima\n16 to 90 Degrees\nBelow FL 180- same as subparagraphs a1 or 2.\nFL 180 to FL 230 inclusive- 14 miles.\nAbove FL 230 to FL 600 inclusive- 17 miles.\nWhen course change is 91 degrees through 180 degrees, protect the airspace on the overflown side beginning at the point where the course changes as follows: (See FIG 6-5-6.)\nBelow FL 180- same as subparagraphs a1 or 2.\nFL 180 to FL 230 inclusive- 28 miles.\nAbove FL 230 to FL 600 inclusive- 34 miles.\nFIG 6-5-6Overflown Side Minima\n91 to 180 Degrees\nAfter the course changes specified in subparagraphs b or c have been completed and the aircraft is back on course, the appropriate minima in subparagraph a may be used.\nRNAV MINIMA- DIVERGING/CROSSING COURSES\nConsider lateral separation to exist when an RNAV aircraft is beyond the point where the lateral protected airspace of that aircraft has ceased to overlap the lateral protected airspace of another by at least: (See FIG 6-5-7 and FIG 6-5-8.)\nFIG 6-5-7RNAV Minima\nWhen operating along a route that is 8 miles or less in width- 4 miles.\nWhen operating along any route segment that is greater than 8 miles in width - 9 miles, except that 15 miles must be applied along that portion of any route segment requiring extended usable distance limitation beyond 130 miles of the reference facility.\nNOTE-\nExcept for GNSS-equipped aircraft /G, /L, /S, and /V, not on a random impromptu route, paragraph 5-5-1, Application, requires radar separation be provided to RNAV aircraft operating at and below FL450 on Q routes or random RNAV routes, excluding oceanic airspace.\nFIG 6-5-8RNAV Minima\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Timed ApproachesAPPLICATION\nTimed approaches using either nonradar procedures or radar vectors to the final approach course may be used at airports served by a tower if the following conditions are met:\nNOTE-\nThese procedures require NAVAIDs and standard/special instrument approach procedures or adequate radar coverage which permit an aircraft to:\nHold at a fix located on the approach course or to be radar vectored to the final approach course for a straight‐in approach in accordance with the minima specified in paragraph 6-7-5, Interval Minima.\nProceed in the direction of the airport along the approach course crossing the holding/approach fix at a specified altitude if required.\nContinue descent for an approach to destination airport.\nDirect communication is maintained with the aircraft until the pilot is instructed to contact the tower.\nIf more than one missed approach procedure is available, none require course reversal.\nIf only one missed approach procedure is available, the following conditions are met:\nCourse reversal is not required.\nReported ceiling and visibility are equal to or greater than the highest prescribed circling minimums for the instrument approach procedure in use.\nNOTE-\nDetermination of whether or not an existing ceiling meets minima is accomplished by comparing MDA (MSL) with ceiling (AGL) plus the airport elevation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-7-2, Approach Sequence.\nAPPROACH SEQUENCE\nWhen an aircraft passes the final approach fix inbound (nonprecision approach) or the outer marker or the fix used in lieu of the outer marker inbound (precision approach), issue clearances for a succeeding timed approach in accordance with the following:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-5, Approach Separation Responsibility.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-7-4, Level Flight Restriction.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-7-7, Missed Approaches.\nClear the succeeding aircraft for approach, to descend to the altitude vacated by the preceding aircraft, and to leave the final approach fix inbound (nonprecision approach) or the outer marker or the fix used in lieu of the outer marker inbound (precision approach) at a specified time; or when using radar to sequence and position aircraft on the final approach course, vector aircraft to cross the final approach fix/outer marker or the fix used in lieu of the outer marker in compliance with paragraph 6-7-5, Interval Minima.\nFIG 6-7-1Timed Approach Procedures\nUsing ILS and Longitudinal Separation Only\nNOTE-\nFIG 6-7-1 depicts the application of timed approach procedures using an ILS and applying longitudinal separation only. Using an interval of 2 minutes between successive approaches, the #1 and #2 aircraft have already passed the outer locator (LOM) on final approach, and the #3 aircraft has been cleared for approach and to depart the LOM 2 minutes after the #2 aircraft reported leaving the LOM inbound on final approach. After aircraft in the approach sequence depart the holding/approach fix (LOM) inbound, vertical separation is no longer provided and longitudinal separation is utilized.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-2, Final Approach Course Interception.\nIf an alternative missed approach procedure is not available and weather conditions are less than required by paragraph 6-7-1, Application, subparagraph c, clear the succeeding aircraft for an approach when the preceding aircraft has landed or canceled its IFR flight plan.\nFIG 6-7-2Timed Approach Procedures Using a Bearing on an NDB and Longitudinal and Vertical Separation\nNOTE-\nFIG 6-7-2 depicts the application of timed approach procedures using a holding/approach fix on a bearing of an NDB and applying a combination of longitudinal and vertical separation. The #3 aircraft has been instructed to descend to 2,000 after the #2 aircraft has reported departing the holding/approach fix inbound and leaving 2,000 at point A. The #2 aircraft has departed the holding/approach fix inbound at the designated time, maintaining 2,000 until cleared for approach at point A. The #1 aircraft has been sighted, enabling the controller to issue approach clearance to the #2 aircraft at point A.\nRelease the aircraft to the tower before it reaches the final approach fix.\nSEQUENCE INTERRUPTION\nInterrupt the established timed approach sequence if necessary to allow an aircraft to execute a different type of approach.\nLEVEL FLIGHT RESTRICTION\nIf the weather report indicates an aircraft will be in IFR conditions over the final approach fix (nonprecision approach) or the outer marker or the fix used in lieu of the outer marker (precision approach) when paragraph 6-7-2, Approach Sequence, subparagraph b is applied, clear the second aircraft for an approach early enough to allow at least 1 minute of level flight before crossing the final approach fix/outer marker or the fix used in lieu of the outer marker.\nINTERVAL MINIMA\nExcept as provided in subparagraph b, use a 2‐minute or a 5‐mile radar interval as the minimum between successive approaches.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-5, Approach Separation Responsibility.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-7-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-7-2, Approach Sequence.\nWAKE TURBULENCE APPLICATION\nUse the following time or radar interval as the minimum interval:\nBehind super:\nHeavy - 3 minutes or 6 miles.\nLarge - 3 minutes or 7 miles.\nSmall - 4 minutes or 8 miles.\nSmall behind heavy - 3 minutes or 6 miles.\nIncrease the interval, as necessary, taking into account the:\nRelative speeds of the aircraft concerned.\nExisting weather conditions.\nDistance between the approach fix and the airport.\nType of approach being made.\nTIME CHECK\nIssue a time check to an aircraft before specifying a time to leave the approach fix inbound unless the aircraft is vectored to the final approach course.\nMISSED APPROACHES\nIf weather conditions are such that an aircraft will likely miss an approach, issue an alternative missed approach procedure to the next aircraft.\nIf an aircraft misses an approach, allow the next aircraft to continue the approach if it has been assigned an alternative missed approach procedure. Retain radar control or hold any remaining aircraft at assigned altitudes until traffic conditions permit the issuance of approach clearances.\nWhen paragraph 6-7-2, Approach Sequence, subparagraph b is applied and the first aircraft misses an approach, retain radar control or clear the second aircraft to maintain the last assigned altitude (minimum holding altitude) and return to the holding/approach fix to hold until traffic conditions permit the issuance of approach clearances.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

ApproachesVISUAL APPROACH\nA visual approach is an ATC authorization for an aircraft on an IFR flight plan to proceed visually and clear of clouds to the airport of intended landing. A visual approach is not a standard instrument approach procedure and has no missed approach segment. An aircraft unable to complete a landing from a visual approach must be handled as any go-around and appropriate IFR separation must be provided until the aircraft lands or the pilot cancels their IFR flight plan.\nAt airports with an operating control tower, aircraft executing a go-around may be directed to:\nEnter the traffic pattern for landing. An altitude assignment is not required. The pilot is expected to climb to pattern altitude and is responsible to maintain terrain and obstruction avoidance. ATC must provide approved separation or visual separation from other IFR aircraft, or\nProceed as otherwise instructed by ATC. The pilot is expected to comply with assigned instructions, and responsible to maintain terrain and obstruction avoidance until reaching an ATC assigned altitude. ATC is responsible to provide instructions to the pilot to facilitate a climb to the minimum altitude for instrument operations. ATC must provide approved separation or visual separation from other IFR aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is responsible for their own terrain and obstruction avoidance during a go-around after conducting a visual approach. The facility can assign headings towards the lowest terrain and obstructions.\nAt airports without an operating control tower, aircraft executing a go-around are expected to complete a landing as soon as possible or contact ATC for further clearance. ATC must maintain approved separation from other IFR aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-20, Wake Turbulence Cautionary Advisories.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-2, Forwarding Approach Information by Nonapproach Control Facilities.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-4-4, Approaches to Multiple Runways.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-16, Go-around/Missed Approach.\nP/CG Term - GO-AROUND.\nAIM, Para 5-4-23, Visual Approach.\nVECTORS FOR VISUAL APPROACH\nA vector for a visual approach may be initiated if the reported ceiling at the airport of intended landing is at least 500 feet above the MVA/MIA and the visibility is 3 miles or greater. At airports without weather reporting service there must be reasonable assurance (e.g. area weather reports, PIREPs, etc.) that descent and flight to the airport can be made visually, and the pilot must be informed that weather information is not available.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Ident) FLY HEADING\nor\nTURN RIGHT/LEFT HEADING (degrees) VECTOR FOR VISUAL APPROACH TO (airport name).\n(If appropriate)\nWEATHER NOT AVAILABLE.\nNOTE-\nAt airports where weather information is not available, a pilot request for a visual approach indicates that descent and flight to the airport can be made visually and clear of clouds.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-1, Vectors to Final Approach Course.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-4-3, Clearance for Visual Approach.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-4-4, Approaches to Multiple Runways.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-6-7, Sequencing.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-7-3, Separation.\nCLEARANCE FOR VISUAL APPROACH\nARTCCs and approach controls may clear aircraft for visual approaches using the following procedures:\nNOTE-\nTowers may exercise this authority when authorized by a LOA with the facility that provides the IFR service, or by a facility directive at collocated facilities.\nControllers may initiate, or pilots may request, a visual approach even when an aircraft is being vectored for an instrument approach and the pilot subsequently reports:\nThe airport or the runway in sight at airports with operating control towers.\nThe airport in sight at airports without a control tower.\nResolve potential conflicts with all other aircraft, advise an overtaking aircraft of the distance to the preceding aircraft and speed difference, and ensure that weather conditions at the airport are VFR or that the pilot has been informed that weather is not available for the destination airport. Upon pilot request, advise the pilot of the frequency to receive weather information where AWOS/ASOS is available.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65 7-4-3b, Clearance for Visual Approach and 4-7-10b(2), Approach Information (12-1-2014)\nClear an aircraft for a visual approach when:\nThe aircraft is number one in the approach sequence, or\nAt locations with an operating control tower, the aircraft is to follow a preceding aircraft and the pilot reports the preceding aircraft in sight and is instructed to follow it to the same runway, or\nNOTE-\nThe pilot need not report the airport/runway in sight.\nAt locations with an operating control tower, the pilot reports the airport or runway in sight but not the preceding aircraft. Radar separation must be maintained until visual separation is provided.\nAt locations without an operating control tower or where part-time towers are closed, do not specify a runway when issuing a visual approach clearance, issue a visual approach clearance to the airport only.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(at locations with an operating control tower)\n(Call sign) (control instructions as required) CLEARED VISUAL APPROACH RUNWAY number);\nor\n(at locations without an operating control tower)\n(Call sign) (control instructions as required) CLEARED VISUAL APPROACH TO (airport name)\n(and if appropriate)\nWEATHER NOT AVAILABLE\nor\nVERIFY THAT YOU HAVE THE (airport) WEATHER.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nAll aircraft following a heavy, or a small aircraft following a B757, must be informed of the airplane manufacturer and/or model.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cessna Three Four Juliett, following a Boeing 757, 12 o'clock, six miles.”\nor\n“Cessna Three Four Juliett, following a Seven fifty seven, 12 o'clock, six miles.\"\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-21, Description of Aircraft Types.\nNOTE-\nVisual separation is not authorized when the lead aircraft is a super.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nInform the tower of the aircraft's position prior to communications transfer at controlled airports. STARS functions may be used provided a facility directive or LOA specifies control and communication transfer points.\nIn addition to the requirements of paragraph 7-4-2, Vectors for Visual Approach, and subparagraphs a, b, c, d, and e, ensure that the location of the destination airport is provided when the pilot is asked to report the destination airport in sight.\nIn those instances where airports are located in close proximity, also provide the location of the airport that may cause the confusion.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cessna Five Six November, Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport is at 12 o'clock, 5 miles. Cleveland Hopkins Airport is at 1 o'clock 12 miles. Report Cleveland Hopkins in sight.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-4-4, Approaches to Multiple Runways.\nAPPROACHES TO MULTIPLE RUNWAYS\nAll aircraft must be informed that approaches are being conducted to parallel, intersecting, or converging runways. This may be accomplished through use of the ATIS.\nWhen conducting visual approaches to multiple runways ensure the following:\nDo not permit the respective aircrafts' primary radar targets/fusion target symbols to touch unless visual separation is being applied.\nWhen the aircraft flight paths intersect, ensure approved separation is maintained until visual separation is applied.\nThe following conditions apply to visual approaches being conducted simultaneously to parallel, intersecting, and converging runways, as appropriate:\nParallel runways separated by less than 2,500 feet. Unless approved separation is provided, an aircraft must report sighting a preceding aircraft making an approach (instrument or visual) to the adjacent parallel runway. When an aircraft reports another aircraft in sight on the adjacent extended runway centerline and visual separation is applied, controllers must advise the succeeding aircraft to maintain visual separation. Do not permit an aircraft to overtake another aircraft when wake turbulence separation is required.\nParallel runways separated by 2,500 feet but less than 4,300 feet.\nWhen aircraft are approaching from opposite base legs, or one aircraft is turning to final and another aircraft is established on the extended centerline for the adjacent runway, approved separation is provided until the aircraft are:\nEstablished on a heading or established on a direct course to a fix or cleared on an RNAV/ instrument approach procedure which will intercept the extended centerline of the runway at an angle not greater than 30 degrees, and,\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65 7-4-4, Approaches to Multiple Runways (8-14-2015)\nOne pilot has acknowledged receipt of a visual approach clearance and the other pilot has acknowledged receipt of a visual or instrument approach clearance.\nWhen aircraft are approaching from the same side of the airport and the lead aircraft is assigned the nearer runway, approved separation is maintained or pilot-applied visual separation is provided by the succeeding aircraft until intercepting the farther adjacent extended runway centerline.\nProvided that aircraft flight paths do not intersect, when the provisions of subparagraphs (a), (b), or (d) are met, it is not necessary to apply any other type of separation with aircraft on the adjacent extended runway centerline.\nWhen aircraft are approaching from the same side of the airport and the lead aircraft is assigned the farther runway, the succeeding aircraft must be assigned a heading that will intercept the extended centerline of the nearer runway at an angle not greater than 30 degrees. Approved separation must be maintained or pilot-applied visual separation must be provided by the succeeding aircraft until it is established on the extended centerline of the nearer runway.\nNOTE-\nThe intent of the 30 degree intercept angle is to reduce the potential for overshoots of the extended centerline of the runway and preclude side‐by‐side operations with one or both aircraft in a “belly‐up” configuration during the turn. Aircraft performance, speed, and the number of degrees of the turn are factors to be considered when vectoring aircraft to parallel runways.\nThe 30‐degree intercept angle is not necessary when approved separation is maintained until the aircraft are established on the extended centerline of the assigned runway.\nVariances between heading assigned to intercept the extended centerline of the runway and aircraft ground track are expected due to the effect of wind and course corrections after completion of the turn and pilot acknowledgment of a visual approach clearance.\nProcedures using Radius‐to‐Fix legs that intercept final may be used in lieu of the 30‐degree intercept provisions contained in this paragraph.\nParallel runways separated by 4,300 feet or more.\nWhen aircraft are approaching from opposite base legs, or one aircraft is turning to final and another aircraft is established on the extended centerline for the adjacent runway, approved separation is provided until the aircraft are:\nAssigned a heading or established on a direct course to a fix or cleared on an RNAV/instrument approach procedure which will intercept the extended centerline of the runway at an angle not greater than 30 degrees, and,\nOne of the aircraft has been issued and the pilot has acknowledged receipt of the visual approach clearance.\nWhen aircraft are approaching from the same side of the airport and the lead aircraft is assigned the nearer runway, approved separation is maintained or pilot-applied visual separation is provided by the succeeding aircraft until intercepting the farther adjacent extended runway centerline.\nProvided that aircraft flight paths do not intersect, when the provisions of subparagraphs (a), (b), or (d) are met, it is not necessary to apply any other type of separation with aircraft on the adjacent extended runway centerline.\nWhen aircraft are approaching from the same side of the airport and the lead aircraft is assigned the farther runway, the succeeding aircraft must be assigned a heading that will intercept the extended centerline of the nearer runway at an angle not greater than 30 degrees.

A Special VFR clearance is required.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR Section 91.155(c), Basic VFR Weather Minimums.\nNOTE-\nVFR operations are authorized within a surface area when operating above a ceiling that is reported as less than 1,000 feet AGL in accordance with 14 CFR section 91.155(a).\nSVFR operations may be authorized for aircraft operating in or transiting a Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area when the primary airport is reporting VFR but the pilot advises that basic VFR cannot be maintained.\nNOTE-\nThe basic requirements for issuance of a SVFR clearance in subparagraph a apply with the obvious exception that weather conditions at the controlling airport are not required to be less than basic VFR minima.\nPRIORITY\nSVFR flights may be approved only if arriving and departing IFR aircraft are not delayed.\nEXAMPLE-\nA SVFR aircraft has been cleared to enter a Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area and subsequently an IFR aircraft is ready to depart or is in position to begin an approach. Less overall delay might accrue to the IFR aircraft if the SVFR aircraft is allowed to proceed to the airport and land, rather than leave, a Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area or be repositioned to provide IFR priority.\nA SVFR aircraft is number one for takeoff and located in such a position that the number two aircraft, an IFR flight, cannot taxi past to gain access to the runway. Less overall delay might accrue to the IFR aircraft by releasing the SVFR departure rather than by having the aircraft taxi down the runway to a turnoff point so the IFR aircraft could be released first.\nNOTE-\nThe priority afforded IFR aircraft over SVFR aircraft is not intended to be so rigidly applied that inefficient use of airspace results. The controller has the prerogative of permitting completion of a SVFR operation already in progress when an IFR aircraft becomes a factor if better overall efficiency will result.\nInform an aircraft of the anticipated delay when a SVFR clearance cannot be granted because of IFR traffic. Do not issue an EFC or expected departure time.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT (number) MINUTES DELAY, (additional instructions as necessary).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-1, Application.\nSEPARATION\nApply nonradar or visual separation between:\nSVFR fixed-wing aircraft.\nSVFR fixed-wing aircraft and SVFR Helicopters.\nSVFR fixed-wing aircraft and IFR aircraft.\nNOTE-\nVertical separation is authorized between SVFR fixed‐wing aircraft and IFR aircraft as prescribed in FAA Order JO 7110.65, paragraph 7-5-4, Altitude Assignments\nDue to the requirements for SVFR fixed-wing aircraft to maintain 1-mile flight visibility and to remain clear of clouds, radar separation is not authorized during SVFR fixed-wing operations. Radar vectors are authorized, as prescribed in paragraph 5-6-1, Application, subparagraph f, to expedite the entrance, exit, and transition of SVFR fixed‐wing aircraft through the appropriate surface area.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 6, Nonradar.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-5-4, Altitude Assignment.\nApply nonradar, visual, or IFR radar separation between:\nSVFR Helicopters.\nSVFR Helicopters and IFR aircraft.\nNOTE-\nVertical separation is authorized between SVFR helicopters and IFR aircraft as prescribed in FAA Order JO 7110.65, paragraph 7-5-4, Altitude Assignments.\nRadar separation as prescribed in Chapter 5 may be applied provided that the facility conducting the operation is authorized to provide radar separation services in accordance with FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 10-5-3, Functional Use of Certified Tower Radar Displays (CTRD), subparagraph b5, and subparagraph d. Facilities that are not delegated airspace or separation responsibility must use CTRDs in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.65, paragraph 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays, subparagraph b.\nAlternate SVFR helicopter separation minima may be established when warranted by the volume and/or complexity of local helicopter operations. Alternate SVFR helicopter separation minima must be established with an LOA with the helicopter operator which must specify, as a minimum, that SVFR helicopters are to maintain visual reference to the surface and adhere to the following aircraft separation minima:\nBetween a SVFR helicopter and an arriving or departing IFR aircraft:\n1/2 mile. If the IFR aircraft is less than 1 mile from the landing airport.\n1 mile. If the IFR aircraft is 1 mile or more from the airport.\n1 mile between SVFR helicopters. This separation may be reduced to 200 feet if:\nBoth helicopters are departing simultaneously on courses that diverge by at least 30 degrees and:\nThe tower can determine this separation by reference to surface markings; or\nOne of the departing helicopters is instructed to remain at least 200 feet from the other.\nNOTE-\nVertical separation is authorized between SVFR helicopters and IFR aircraft as prescribed in FAA Order JO 7110.65, paragraph 7-5-4, Altitude Assignments.\nRadar separation as prescribed in Chapter 5 may be applied provided that the facility conducting the operation is authorized to provide radar separation services in accordance with FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 10-5-3, Functional Use of Certified Tower Radar Displays (CTRD), subparagraph b5, and subparagraph d.

Treat requests for SVFR fixed‐wing operations as follows when the ground visibility is officially reported at an airport as less than 1 mile:\nInform departing aircraft that ground visibility is less than 1 mile and that a clearance cannot be issued.\nInform arriving aircraft, operating outside of a Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area, that ground visibility is less than 1 mile and that, unless an emergency exists, a clearance cannot be issued.\nInform arriving aircraft, operating VFR/SVFR within a Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area, that ground visibility is less than 1 mile and request the pilot to advise intentions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Name of airport) VISIBILITY LESS THAN 1 MILE. ADVISE INTENTIONS.\nNOTE-\nClear an aircraft to land at an airport with an operating control tower, traffic permitting, if the pilot reports the airport in sight. The pilot is responsible to continue to the airport or exit the surface area. 14 CFR section 91.157 prohibits VFR aircraft (other than helicopters) from landing at any airport within a surface area when ground visibility is less than 1 mile. A pilot could inadvertently encounter conditions that are below SVFR minimums after entering a surface area due to rapidly changing weather. The pilot is best suited to determine the action to be taken since pilots operating under SVFR between sunrise and sunset are not required to be instrument rated, and the possibility exists that flight visibility may not be the same as ground visibility. 14 CFR section 91.3 authorizes a pilot encountering an inflight emergency requiring immediate action to deviate from any rule of 14 CFR part 91 to the extent required to meet that emergency. Flight into adverse weather conditions may require the pilot to execute the emergency authority granted in 14 CFR section 91.3 and continue inbound to land.\nAuthorize scheduled air carrier aircraft in the U.S. to conduct operations if ground visibility is not less than 1/2 statute mile.\nNOTE-\n14 CFR part 121 permits landing or takeoff by domestic scheduled air carriers where a local surface restriction to visibility is not less than 1/2 statute mile, provided all turns after takeoff or before landing and all flights beyond 1 statute mile from the airport boundary can be accomplished above or outside the area so restricted. The pilot is solely responsible for determining if the nature of the visibility restriction will permit compliance with the provisions of 14 CFR part 121.\nClear an aircraft to fly through the Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area if the aircraft reports flight visibility is at least 1 statute mile.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-5-1, Authorization.\nFLIGHT VISIBILITY BELOW 1 MILE\nTreat requests for SVFR fixed‐wing operations as follows when weather conditions are not reported at an airport and the pilot advises the flight visibility is less than 1 mile:\nNOTE-\n14 CFR part 91 prescribes the visibility for basic VFR and SVFR operations as the official reported ground visibility at airports where provided and landing or takeoff “flight visibility” where there is no official reported ground visibility.\nInform departing aircraft that a clearance cannot be issued.\nInform arriving aircraft operating outside of a Class B, Class C, Class D or Class E surface area that a clearance cannot be issued unless an emergency exists.\nRequest the intentions of an arriving aircraft operating within a Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area.\nNOTE-\nClear an aircraft to land at an airport with an operating control tower, traffic permitting, if the pilot reports the airport in sight.

Basic Radar Service to VFR Aircraft- TerminalAPPLICATION\nBasic radar services for VFR aircraft must include:\nSafety alerts.\nTraffic advisories.\nLimited radar vectoring when requested by the pilot.\nSequencing at locations where procedures have been established for this purpose and/or when covered by a LOA.\nApply the procedures contained in paragraph 7-1-3, Approach Control Service for VFR Arriving Aircraft, when arriving VFR aircraft are handled by approach control and provide vectoring service in accordance with Chapter 5, Radar, Section 7, Speed Adjustment, in addition to the radar services prescribed in paragraph 5-6-1, Application, and paragraph 5-6-2, Methods.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-16, Surface Areas.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-6-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 12, Section 1, Terminal VFR Radar Services.\nAIM, Para 4-1-18, Terminal Radar Services for VFR Aircraft.\nSERVICE AVAILABILITY\nInform aircraft on initial contact whenever this service cannot be provided because of radar outage and apply paragraph 7-1-3, Approach Control Service for VFR Arriving Aircraft.\nProvide the service, to the extent possible using an available frequency, if an aircraft desires the service but cannot communicate on the appropriate frequencies. Aircraft which do not desire radar service may be fitted into the landing sequence by the tower. Coordination of these aircraft must be accomplished with the approach control unless a facility directive/LOA prescribes otherwise. Nonparticipating aircraft must, to the extent possible, be given the same landing sequence they would have received had they been sequenced by radar vectors.\nRadar sequencing to the primary airport, when local procedures have been developed, must be provided unless the pilot states that the service is not requested. Arriving aircraft are assumed to want radar service unless the pilot states “Negative radar service,” or makes a similar comment.\nINITIAL CONTACT\nAn aircraft sighted by the local controller at the time of first radio contact may be positioned in the landing sequence after coordination with approach control.\nIDENTIFICATION\nIdentify the aircraft before taking action to position it in the approach sequence.\nHOLDING\nHold VFR aircraft over the initial reporting fix or a fix near the airport when holding is required to establish an approach sequence.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-1-4, Visual Holding of VFR Aircraft.\nAPPROACH SEQUENCE\nDo not assign landing sequence numbers, when establishing aircraft in the approach sequence, unless this responsibility has been delegated in a LOA or facility directive.\nNOTE-\nThe landing sequence is ordinarily established by the tower.\nSEQUENCING\nEstablish radar contact before instructing a VFR aircraft to enter the traffic pattern at a specified point or vectoring the aircraft to a position in the approach sequence. Inform the pilot of the aircraft to follow when the integrity of the approach sequence is dependent on following a preceding aircraft. Ensure visual contact is established with the aircraft to follow and provide instruction to follow that aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nFOLLOW (description) (position, if necessary).\nDirect a VFR aircraft to a point near the airport to hold when a position is not available in the approach sequence for the runway in use. The aircraft may be vectored to another runway after coordination with the tower.\nApply the following procedures to a VFR aircraft being radar sequenced:\nThe provisions of paragraph 5-5-4, Minima, subparagraphs f and g.\nWhen parallel runways are less than 2,500 feet apart, do not permit a super or heavy aircraft to overtake any aircraft, nor a B757 or other large aircraft to overtake a small aircraft established on final within the facility's area of responsibility.\nCONTROL TRANSFER\nInform the tower of the aircraft's position and then instruct the pilot to contact the tower.\nThe aircraft may be instructed to contact the tower prior to the tower being advised of the aircraft's position provided:\nThe tower advises the aircraft is in sight, and\nSpace is available in the landing sequence.\nInstruct the pilot to contact the tower at the appropriate point when the approach control STARS track data is being displayed on the tower's TDW display, the aircraft is tagged by STARS, and a facility directive specifies change of communications and control jurisdiction points.\nNOTE-\nThe point at which an aircraft is instructed to contact the tower is determined by prior coordination between the tower and approach control and will vary, depending on the runway in use, weather, etc. The transfer of communications ordinarily occurs at least 5 miles from the runway. The point for the transfer of communications should be a sufficient distance from the airport to permit the tower to properly sequence the aircraft, but not at a distance that could derogate the provision of radar traffic information service.\nABANDONED APPROACH\nInstruct the aircraft to change to approach control for sequencing when an aircraft, under tower control, abandons the approach and coordination with approach control reveals no immediate space in the approach sequence.\nVFR DEPARTURE INFORMATION\nInform departing VFR aircraft who request radar traffic advisories when to contact departure control and the frequency to use. Provide traffic advisories in accordance with paragraph 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories, after the departure is radar identified.\nNOTE-\nDeparting aircraft desiring traffic information are expected to request the service and to state their proposed direction of flight upon initial contact with ground control.\nTERMINATION OF SERVICE\nBasic radar services should be provided to the extent possible, workload permitting. Terminate radar service to aircraft landing at airports other than those where sequencing service is provided at a sufficient distance from the airport to permit the pilot to change to the appropriate frequency for traffic and airport information.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR SERVICE TERMINATED, SQUAWK ONE TWO ZERO ZERO,\nor\nSQUAWK VFR,\nthen\nCHANGE TO ADVISORY FREQUENCY APPROVED,\nor\nCONTACT (frequency identification),\nor\nFREQUENCY CHANGE APPROVED.\nSERVICE PROVIDED WHEN TOWER IS INOPERATIVE\nProvide the following services during hours when the tower is not in operation:\nWind direction and velocity.\nNOTE-\nIssue information provided from the FSS or WSO. Otherwise, inform the pilot that wind information is not available.\nTraffic information.\nInform aircraft when radar service is terminated.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-1-9, Radar Service Termination.\nDo not assign landing sequence.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Class C Service- TerminalAPPLICATION\nApply Class C service procedures within the designated Class C airspace and the associated outer area. Class C services are designed to keep ATC informed of all aircraft within Class C airspace, not to exclude operations. Two‐way radio communications and operational transponder are normally required for operations within Class C airspace, but operations without radio communications or transponder can be conducted by LOA, facility directive, or special arrangement with Class C airspace controlling facility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\n14 CFR Section 91.215, ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use.\nCLASS C SERVICES\nClass C services include the following:\nSequencing of all aircraft to the primary airport.\nStandard IFR services to IFR aircraft.\nSeparation, traffic advisories, and safety alerts between IFR and VFR aircraft.\nMandatory traffic advisories and safety alerts between VFR aircraft.\nProvide Class C services to all aircraft operating within Class C airspace.\nProvide Class C services to all participating aircraft in the outer area.\nAircraft should not normally be held. However, if holding is necessary, inform the pilot of the expected length of delay.\nWhen an outage occurs, affecting the preferred radar sensor, advise aircraft that Class C services are not available and, if appropriate, when to contact the tower, except when other radar resources are available and to the extent that coverage is sufficient, continue to provide radar services.\nNOTE-\nLimited radar coverage in one portion of a Class C area does not justify denial of Class C radar service in the entire area.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nSEPARATION\nSeparate VFR aircraft from IFR aircraft by any one of the following:\nVisual separation as specified in paragraph 7-2-1, Visual Separation, paragraph 7-4-2, Vectors for Visual Approach, and paragraph 7-6-7, Sequencing.\nNOTE-\nIssue wake turbulence cautionary advisories in accordance with paragraph 2-1-20, Wake Turbulence Cautionary Advisories.\n500 feet vertical separation.\nTarget resolution, except when ISR is being displayed.\nNOTE-\nApply the provisions of paragraph 5-5-4, Minima, subparagraphs g and h, when wake turbulence separation is required.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nESTABLISHING TWO‐WAY COMMUNICATIONS\nClass C service requires pilots to establish two‐way radio communications before entering Class C airspace. If the controller responds to a radio call with, “(a/c call sign) standby,” radio communications have been established and the pilot can enter Class C airspace. If workload or traffic conditions prevent immediate provision of Class C services, inform the pilot to remain outside Class C airspace until conditions permit the services to be provided.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(A/c call sign) REMAIN OUTSIDE CHARLIE AIRSPACE AND STANDBY.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nALTITUDE ASSIGNMENTS\nWhen necessary to assign altitudes to VFR aircraft, assign altitudes that meet the MVA, MSA, or minimum IFR altitude criteria.\nAircraft assigned altitudes which are contrary to 14 CFR section 91.159 must be advised to resume altitudes appropriate for the direction of flight when the altitude is no longer needed for separation, when leaving the outer area, or when terminating Class C service.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRESUME APPROPRIATE VFR ALTITUDES.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-2-1, Visual Separation.\nEXCEPTIONS\nVFR helicopters need not be separated from IFR helicopters. Traffic information and safety alerts must be issued as appropriate.\nHot air balloons need not be separated from IFR aircraft. Traffic information and safety alerts must be issued as appropriate.\nADJACENT AIRPORT OPERATIONS\nAircraft that will penetrate Class C airspace after departing controlled airports within or adjacent to Class C airspace must be provided the same services as those aircraft departing the primary airport. Procedures for handling this situation must be covered in a LOA or a facility directive, as appropriate.\nAircraft departing uncontrolled airports within Class C airspace must be handled using procedures advertised in a Letter to Airmen.\nTERMINATION OF SERVICE\nUnless aircraft are landing at secondary airports or have requested termination of service while in the outer area, provide services until the aircraft departs the associated outer area. Terminate Class C service to aircraft landing at other than the primary airport at a sufficient distance from the airport to allow the pilot to change to the appropriate frequency for traffic and airport information.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCHANGE TO ADVISORY FREQUENCY APPROVED,\nor\nCONTACT (facility identification).\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Since aircraft will not fly into adverse meteorological conditions, weather deviation requests should take priority over routine requests. If there is no traffic in the horizontal dimension, ATC must issue clearance to deviate from track; or if there is conflicting traffic in the horizontal dimension, ATC must separate aircraft by establishing vertical separation, then issue clearance to deviate from track. If there is conflicting traffic and ATC is unable to establish required separation, ATC must:\nAdvise the pilot unable to issue clearance for requested deviation;\nAdvise the pilot of conflicting traffic; and\nRequest pilot's intentions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNABLE (requested deviation), TRAFFIC IS (call sign, position, altitude, direction), SAY INTENTIONS.\nNOTE-\nThe pilot will advise ATC of intentions by the most expeditious means available.\nIn the event that pilot/controller communications cannot be established or a revised ATC clearance is not available, pilots will follow the procedures outlined in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), Section ENR 7.3, Special Procedures for In‐flight Contingencies in Oceanic Airspace; and AC 91-70, Oceanic and Remote Continental Airspace Operations.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Longitudinal SeparationAPPLICATION\nLongitudinal separation must be applied so that the spacing between the estimated positions of the aircraft being separated is never less than a prescribed minimum.\nNOTE-\nConsider separation to exist when the estimated positions of the aircraft being separated are never less than a prescribed minimum.\nIn situations where one aircraft requires a different time-based longitudinal standard than another, apply the larger of the two standards between the aircraft concerned.\nLongitudinal separation expressed in distance may be applied as prescribed in Chapter 6, Nonradar.\nIn situations where an update to a control estimate indicates that the minimum being applied no longer exists, controllers must ensure that separation is reestablished. Issue traffic information as necessary.\nSEPARATION METHODS\nFor the purpose of application of longitudinal separation, the terms same track must be considered identical to same course, reciprocal tracks must be considered identical to reciprocal courses, and crossing tracks, must be considered identical to crossing courses.\nNOTE-\nRefer to paragraph 1-2-2, Course Definitions.\nSeparate aircraft longitudinally in accordance with the following:\nSame track. Ensure that the estimated spacing between aircraft is not less than the applicable minimum required. (See FIG 8-3-1.)\nFIG 8-3-1Same Courses\nCrossing tracks. Ensure that the estimated spacing at the point of intersection is not less than the applicable minimum required. (See FIG 8-3-2.)\nFIG 8-3-2Crossing Courses\nReciprocal tracks:\nEnsure that aircraft are vertically separated for a time interval equal to the applicable minimum required before and after the aircraft are estimated to pass. (See FIG 8-3-3.)\nFIG 8-3-3Reciprocal Courses\nVertical separation may be discontinued after one of the following conditions is met:\nBoth aircraft have reported passing a significant point and the aircraft are separated by at least the applicable minimum required for the same direction longitudinal spacing; (See FIG 8-3-4.) or\nFIG 8-3-4Vertical Separation\nBoth aircraft have reported passing ground‐based NAVAIDs or DME fixes indicating that they have passed each other.\nMACH NUMBER TECHNIQUE\nThe use of Mach number technique allows for the application of reduced longitudinal separation minima. The following conditions must be met when the Mach number technique is being applied:\nAircraft Types: Turbojet aircraft only.\nRoutes:\nThe aircraft follow the same track or continuously diverging tracks, and\nThe aircraft concerned have reported over a common point; or\nIf the aircraft have not reported over a common point, the appropriate time interval being applied between aircraft exists and will exist at the common point; or,\nIf a common point does not exist, the appropriate time interval being applied between aircraft exists and will exist at significant points along each track.\nAltitudes: The aircraft concerned are in level, climbing or descending flight.\nMach Number Assignment:\nA Mach number (or, when appropriate, a range of Mach numbers) must be issued to each aircraft unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of ICAO regional agreement.\nNOTE-\nThe application of Mach number technique requires pilots to strictly adhere to the last assigned Mach number (or range of Mach numbers), even during climbs and descents, unless revised by ATC. Turbojet aircraft must request ATC approval before making any changes. If it is essential to make an immediate temporary change in the Mach number (e.g., due to turbulence), ATC must be notified as soon as possible that such a change has been made.\nWhen it is necessary to issue crossing restrictions to ensure the appropriate time interval, it may be impossible for an aircraft to comply with both the clearance to meet the crossing restrictions and the clearance to maintain a single, specific Mach number.\nREFERENCE-\nICAO DOC 9426-AN/924, Part II, Section 2, Para 2.3.4, Para 2.4.7, and Para 2.5.3.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Maintain Mach point eight four or greater.”\n“Maintain Mach point eight three or less.”\n“Maintain Mach point eight two or greater; do not exceed Mach point eight four.”\nLongitudinal Minima:\nWhen the Mach number technique is applied, minimum longitudinal separation must be:\n10 minutes, provided that:\nThe preceding aircraft maintains a Mach number equal to, or greater than that maintained by the following aircraft; or\nWhen the following aircraft is faster than the preceding aircraft, at least 10 minutes exists until another form of separation is achieved; or\nBetween 9 and 5 minutes inclusive, provided that the preceding aircraft is maintaining a Mach number greater than the following aircraft in accordance with the following:\n9 minutes, if the preceding aircraft is Mach 0.02 faster than the following aircraft;\n8 minutes, if the preceding aircraft is Mach 0.03 faster than the following aircraft;\n7 minutes, if the preceding aircraft is Mach 0.04 faster than the following aircraft;\n6 minutes, if the preceding aircraft is Mach 0.05 faster than the following aircraft;\n5 minutes, if the preceding aircraft is Mach 0.06 faster than the following aircraft.\nNOTE-\nA “rule-of-thumb” may be applied to assist in providing the required estimated spacing over the oceanic exit point when either conflict probe is not in use or when requested by another facility. This rule-of-thumb can be stated as follows: For each 600 NM in distance between the entry and exit points of the area where the Mach Number Technique is used, add 1 minute for each 0.01 difference in Mach number for the two aircraft concerned to compensate for the fact that the second aircraft is overtaking the first aircraft.

Lateral SeparationAPPLICATION\nSeparate aircraft by assigning different flight paths whose widths or protected airspace do not overlap.\nWithin that portion of the Gulf of America Low Offshore airspace, use 12 NM between aircraft whose flight paths are defined by published Grid System waypoints.\nNOTE-\nThe Grid System is defined as those waypoints contained within the Gulf of America Low Offshore airspace and published on the IFR Vertical Flight Reference Chart.\nLateral separation minima is contained in:\nSection 7, North Atlantic ICAO Region.\nSection 8, Caribbean ICAO Region.\nSection 9, Pacific ICAO Region.\nSection 10, North American ICAO Region- Arctic CTA.\nSEPARATION METHODS\nLateral separation exists for:\nNonintersecting flight paths:\nWhen the required distance is maintained between the flight paths; or (See FIG 8-4-1.)\nFIG 8-4-1Separation Methods\nWhen reduced route protected airspace is applicable, and the protected airspace of the flight paths do not overlap; or (See FIG 8-4-2.)\nFIG 8-4-2Separation Methods\nWhen aircraft are crossing an oceanic boundary and are entering an airspace with a larger lateral minimum than the airspace being exited; and\nThe smaller separation exists at the boundary; and\nFlight paths diverge by 15° or more until the larger minimum is established. (See FIG 8-4-3.)\nFIG 8-4-3Separation Methods\nIntersecting flight paths with constant and same width protected airspace when either aircraft is at or beyond a distance equal to the applicable lateral separation minimum measured perpendicular to the flight path of the other aircraft. (See FIG 8-4-4.)\nFIG 8-4-4Separation Methods\nIntersecting flight paths with constant but different width protected airspace when either aircraft is at or beyond a distance equal to the sum of the protected airspace of both flight paths measured perpendicular to the flight path of the other aircraft. (See FIG 8-4-5.)\nFIG 8-4-5Separation Methods\nIntersecting flight paths with variable width protected airspace when either aircraft is at or beyond a distance equal to the sum of the protected airspace of both flight paths measured perpendicular to the flight path of the other aircraft. Measure protected airspace for each aircraft perpendicular to its flight path at the first point or the last point, as applicable, of protected airspace overlap.\nNOTE-\nIn FIG 8-4-5, the protected airspace for westbound flight A is distance “a” (50 miles), and for southwestbound flight B, distance “b” (10 miles). Therefore, the sum of distances “a” and “b”; i.e., the protected airspace of Aircrafts A and B, establishes the lateral separation minimum (60 miles) applicable for either flight relevant to the other.\nFIG 8-4-6Separation Methods\nNOTE-\n(See FIG 8-4-6.) At the first point of protected airspace overlap, the protected airspace for westbound flight A is distance “a” (50 miles), and for southbound flight B, distance “b” (40 miles). The sum of distances “a” and “b” (90 miles) establishes the lateral separation minimum applicable in this example for either flight as it approaches the intersection. For example, Aircraft B should be vertically separated from Aircraft A by the time it reaches point “p.”\nFIG 8-4-7Separation Methods\nNOTE-\n(See FIG 8-4-7.) Distance “a” (50 miles) and “b” (30 miles) are determined at the last point of protected airspace overlap. The sum of the distances “a” and “b” (80 miles) establishes the lateral separation minima applicable for either flight after it passes beyond the intersection. For example, Aircraft B could be cleared to, or through, Aircraft A's altitude after passing point “r.”\nREDUCTION OF ROUTE PROTECTED AIRSPACE\nWhen routes have been satisfactorily flight checked and notice has been given to users, reduction in route protected airspace may be made as follows:\nBelow FL 240, reduce the width of the protected airspace to 5 miles on each side of the route centerline to a distance of 57.14 miles from the NAVAID, then increasing in width on a 5° angle from the route centerline, measured at the NAVAID, to the maximum width allowable within the lateral minima; for example, 50 miles of protected airspace on each side of centerline; i.e., a lateral minimum of 100 miles. (See FIG 8-4-8.)\nFIG 8-4-8Reduction of Route Protected Airspace\nAt and above FL 240, reduce the width of the protected airspace to 10 miles on each side of the route centerline to a distance of 114.29 miles from the NAVAID, then increasing in width on a 5° angle from the route centerline, as measured at the NAVAID, to the maximum width allowable within the lateral minima; for example, 60 miles of protected airspace on each side of the centerline; i.e., a lateral separation minimum of 120 miles. (See FIG 8-4-9.)\nFIG 8-4-9Reduction of Route Protected Airspace\nTRACK SEPARATION\nApply track separation between aircraft by requiring aircraft to fly specified tracks or radials and with specified spacings as follows:\nSame NAVAID:\nVOR/VORTAC/TACAN. Consider separation to exist between aircraft established on radials of the same NAVAID that diverge by at least 15 degrees when either aircraft is clear of the airspace to be protected for the other aircraft. Use TBL 8-4-1 to determine the flight distance required for various divergence angles and altitudes to clear the airspace to be protected. (See FIG 8-4-10.)\nTBL 8-4-1Divergence‐Distance Minima\nVOR/VORTAC/TACAN\nDivergence (degrees)\nDistance (mile)\nFL 230 and below\nFL 240 through\nFL 450\n15-25\n17\n18\n26-35\n11\n13\n36-90\n8\n11\nNote: This table compensates for DME slant range error.\nFIG 8-4-10Track Separation VOR\nNDB:\nConsider separation to exist between aircraft established on tracks of the same NAVAID that diverge by at least 30 degrees and one aircraft is at least 15 miles from the NAVAID. This separation must not be used when one or both aircraft are inbound to the aid unless the distance of the aircraft from the facility can be readily determined by reference to the NAVAID. Use TBL 8-4-2 to determine the flight distance required for various divergence angles to clear the airspace to be protected. For divergence that falls between two values, use the lesser value to obtain the distance. (See FIG 8-4-11.)\nTBL 8-4-2Divergence‐Distance Minima (NDB)\nDivergence (degrees)\nDistance (mile)\nFL 230 and below\nFL 240 through\nFL 450\n30\n15\n17\n45\n13\n14\n60\n9\n10\n75\n7\n8\n90\n6\n7\nNote: This table compensates for DME slant range error.\nFIG 8-4-11Track Separation NDB\nClear aircraft navigating on NDB facilities in accordance with paragraph 2-5-2, NAVAID Terms.\nDifferent NAVAIDs: Separate aircraft using different navigation aids by assigning tracks so that their protected airspace does not overlap.

Offshore/Oceanic Transition ProceduresALTITUDE/FLIGHT LEVEL TRANSITION\nWhen vertical separation is applied between aircraft crossing the offshore/oceanic airspace boundary below FL 180, control action must be taken to ensure that differences between the standard altimeter setting (QNE) and local altimeter setting (QNH) do not compromise separation. (See FIG 8-5-1.)\nFIG 8-5-1Standard and Local Altimeter Setting Differences\nCOURSE DIVERGENCE\nWhen aircraft are entering oceanic airspace, separation will exist in oceanic airspace when:\nAircraft are established on courses that diverge by at least 15 degrees until oceanic lateral separation is established, and\nThe aircraft are horizontally radar separated and separation is increasing at the edge of known radar coverage.\nOPPOSITE DIRECTION\nWhen transitioning from an offshore airspace area to oceanic airspace, an aircraft may climb through opposite direction oceanic traffic provided vertical separation above that traffic is established:\nBefore the outbound crosses the offshore/oceanic boundary; and\n15 minutes before the aircraft are estimated to pass. (See FIG 8-5-2.)\nFIG 8-5-2Transitioning From Offshore to Oceanic Airspace Opposite Direction\nSAME DIRECTION\nWhen transitioning from an offshore airspace area to oceanic airspace or while within oceanic airspace, apply 5 minutes minimum separation when a following aircraft on the same course is climbing through the altitude of the preceding aircraft if the following conditions are met:\nThe preceding aircraft is level at the assigned altitude and is maintaining a speed equal to or greater than the following aircraft; and\nThe minimum of 5 minutes is maintained between the preceding and following aircraft; and\nThe following aircraft is separated by not more than 4,000 feet from the preceding aircraft when the climb clearance is issued; and\nThe following aircraft commences climb within 10 minutes after passing:\nAn exact reporting point (DME fix or intersection formed from NAVAIDs) which the preceding aircraft has reported; or\nA radar observed position over which the preceding aircraft has been observed; and\nThe following aircraft is in direct communication with air traffic control until vertical separation is established. (See FIG 8-5-3.)\nFIG 8-5-3Transitioning From Offshore to Oceanic Airspace Same Direction\nRADAR IDENTIFICATION APPLICATION\nRadar separation standards may be applied between radar identified aircraft and another aircraft not yet identified that is in transit from oceanic airspace or nonradar offshore airspace into an area of known radar coverage where radar separation is applied provided:\nDirect radio communications is maintained with one of the aircraft involved and there is an ability to communicate with the other;\nThe transiting aircraft is RNAV equipped;\nThe performance of the radar/system is adequate;\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-1-1, Presentation and Equipment Performance.\nFlight data on the aircraft that has not been radar identified indicate that it is equipped with a standard transponder and there is no known information that the transponder is not operating;\nRadar separation standards are maintained between the radar identified aircraft and any other observed targets until the transitioning aircraft is radar identified or nonradar separation is established;\nThe facility has identified areas of known radar coverage, incorporated those areas into facility standard operating procedures (SOP), and provided training to the controllers.\nThis procedure is also applicable to aircraft in transit from oceanic airspace into Guam Control Area (CTA), San Juan CTA and Honolulu CTA radar coverage areas.\nEXCEPTION: This procedure is not authorized if there is insufficient time for the controller to establish other approved separation in the event of a delay or inability to establish radar identification of the transiting aircraft taking into consideration factors such as aircraft performance characteristics, type, and speed; weather, traffic conditions; workload; frequency congestion; etc.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data, Subpara b.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 8-1-8, Use of Control Estimates.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

These flights are coordinated with appropriate facilities before departure.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8200.1, United States Standard Flight Inspection Manual.\nFAA Order 8240.41, Flight Inspection/Air Traffic On‐Site Coordination Requirements.\nSPECIAL HANDLING\nClear the aircraft according to pilot request as soon as practicable. Do not ask the pilot to deviate from his/her planned action except to preclude an emergency situation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8240.41, Flight Inspection/Air Traffic On‐Site Coordination Requirements, Appendix 1, describes certain flight inspection maneuvers in detail.\nIssue radar advisories to the flight inspection aircraft where adequate coverage exists and to the extent permitted by workload.\nSuggest flight path adjustments, as required, for any aircraft which will enter or penetrate an area in which a flight inspection function is being performed.\nProvide special handling, as required, to FAA aircraft conducting flight inspections using the call sign “Flight Check.” Use of the term “recorded run” by Flight Check aircraft indicates automated flight inspections are in progress.\nNOTE-\nFlight Check (FLC) aircraft stating “recorded run” indicates automated flight inspections are in progress. Such inspections necessitate the full length of the runway (including protection of any critical areas) and require the entire procedure to be flown, up to and including the missed approach as needed. Any interruption of a recorded run will require the entire procedure to be reinitiated.\nFlight plan remarks may indicate type NAVAID inspection to be accomplished, e.g., “FC OKC P.”\nAuthorized non-FAA Service Providers conducting Flight Validation activities use the call sign “FLIGHT VAL.” Although these activities are similar to Flight Inspection activities, no additional priority is granted with this call sign.\nFLIGHT CHECK AIRCRAFT\nProvide special handling, as required, to expedite flight inspection of NAVAIDs and RADAR by flight check aircraft.\nNOTE-\nCertain flight inspection maneuvers require operations in close proximity to the surface. These maneuvers can only be performed during daylight visual meteorological conditions. Preplanned automatic flight places the following limitations on the capability of the pilot to adhere to normal ATC clearances:\nRoute of flight - orbital from 6 nautical miles to a maximum of 40 nautical miles from the facility depending on the type of inspection. During commissioning flight checks all SIDs, STARs, airways, DME fixes, and approaches must be flown.\nAltitude assignment - from 1,000 feet above the antenna site up to the minimum en route altitude (MEA).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order 8240.41, Flight Inspection/Air Traffic On‐Site Coordination Requirements, Appendix 1, describes certain flight inspection maneuvers in detail.\nAvoid changes in the route or altitude from that filed by the pilot in the initial flight plan.\nDo not impose air traffic control delays in the flight except to preclude emergency situations.\nDo not change the previously assigned discrete beacon code of special radar accuracy flight check aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 7-1-2, Special Radar Accuracy Checks.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-5-4, ASR Performance Checks.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Special OperationsAIRCRAFT CARRYING DANGEROUS MATERIALS\nProvide the following special handling to military aircraft or military contracted aircraft carrying dangerous materials when:\nThe words “dangerous cargo,” or “inert devices,” or both are contained in the remarks section of the filed flight plan, or\nNOTE-\nCertain types of military flights carrying dangerous materials require strict adherence to military regulations and flight planning along carefully selected routes. These flights must avoid heavily populated areas.\n“Inert devices” are devices containing no dangerous materials but closely resembling nuclear or explosive items that are classified as dangerous and could be easily mistaken for their dangerous counterparts.\nThe pilot uses these words in radio communication.\nIf it becomes necessary to issue a clearance to amend the route/altitude, advise the pilot:\nOf the proposed change, and\nThe amount of delay to expect if it is necessary to maintain the present route/altitude.\nWhen it becomes necessary for the pilot to refuse a clearance amending his/her route/altitude, he/she will advise if the traffic delay is acceptable or if an alternate route/altitude is desired. In such cases, offer all possible assistance.\nWhen the aircraft is provided an en route descent, do not vector the aircraft from the planned route unless the pilot concurs.\nUse special patterns and routings in areas where they have been developed for these flights. If special patterns and routings have not been developed, employ normal procedures.\nCELESTIAL NAVIGATION TRAINING\nEN ROUTE\nApprove flight plans specifying celestial navigation only when it is requested for USAF or USN aircraft.\nNOTE-\nAn ATC clearance must be obtained by the pilot before discontinuing conventional navigation to begin celestial navigation training. The pilot will advise when discontinuing celestial navigation and resuming conventional navigation. Celestial navigation training will be conducted within 30 NM of the route centerline specified in the en route clearance unless otherwise authorized by ATC. During celestial navigation training, the pilot will advise ATC before initiating any heading changes which exceed 20 degrees.\nWithin conterminous U.S. airspace, limit celestial navigation training to transponder‐equipped aircraft within areas of ARTCC radar coverage.\nPrior to control transfer, ensure that the receiving controller is informed of the nature of the celestial navigation training leg.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data.\nEXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS\nWhen notified that an experimental aircraft requires special handling:\nNOTE-\n14 CFR section 91.319(d)(3) requires that each person operating an aircraft with an experimental certificate must notify the control tower of the experimental nature of the aircraft when operating into or out of airports with operating control towers.\nClear the aircraft according to pilot requests as traffic permits and if not contrary to ATC procedures.\nOnce approved, do not ask the pilot to deviate from a planned action except to preclude an emergency situation.\nAt locations where volume or complexity of experimental aircraft operations warrant, a letter of agreement may be consummated between the facility and operator.\nFAA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FLIGHTS\nWhen coordinated in advance and traffic permits, approve requests for special flight procedures from aircraft participating in FAA research and development test activities. These special procedures must be applied to participating aircraft/vehicles.\nNOTE-\nSpecial flight procedures for FAA research and development test activities must be approved by the facility air traffic manager prior to their use.\nFLYNET\nATC personnel at the first facility establishing contact with an aircraft using the code word FLYNET must:\nProvide expeditious handling.\nReport it to the operations supervisor (OS)/controller‐in‐charge (CIC), for reporting to the National Tactical Security Operations (NTSO) Air Traffic Security Coordinator (ATSC) through the Domestic Events Network (DEN).\nAdd to the remarks section of the flight plan that DEN notification has been accomplished.\nNOTE-\nThe code word FLYNET indicates that an aircraft is transporting a nuclear emergency support team or other disaster response teams to a potential or actual nuclear/radiological incident, or to a potential or actual incident involving dangerous chemical agents or other hazardous materials. It is in the public interest that they reach their destination as rapidly as possible.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Miami Center, Energy One Two FLYNET, request clearance direct Dulles.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 9-4-1, FLYNET Flights, Nuclear Emergency Support Teams.\nIFR MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES\nExcept for aircraft operating in the same altitude reservation, clear aircraft into an MTR provided separation will be applied between successive aircraft unless otherwise covered in a letter of agreement between the military scheduling activity and the concerned ATC facility.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED INTO IR (designator).\nMAINTAIN (altitude),\nor\nMAINTAIN IR (designator) ALTITUDE(S),\nor\nMAINTAIN AT OR BELOW (altitude),\nor\nCRUISE (altitude),\nand if required,\nCROSS (fix) AT OR LATER THAN (time).\nUnless otherwise covered in a letter of agreement between the military scheduling activity and the concerned FAA facility, clear aircraft to exit an MTR.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination/clearance limit) FROM IR (designator/exit fix) VIA (route).\nMAINTAIN (altitude).\nIf the provisions of subparagraph a above cannot be accomplished, MTRs may be designated for MARSA operations. To preclude an inadvertent compromise of MARSA standards by ATC, appropriate MARSA application for such routes must be covered in a letter of agreement with the military scheduling activity. Establish separation between aircraft as soon as practicable after operation on the designated MARSA route is ended.\nNOTE-\nFor designated MARSA routes, the military assumes responsibility for separation for MTR aircraft that have passed the primary/alternate entry fix until separation is established by ATC after operations on the MARSA route are completed.\nThe lateral airspace to be protected along an MTR is the designated width of the route.\nPrior to an aircraft entering an MTR, request the pilot's estimate for the route's exit/alternate exit fix, the pilot's requested altitude after exiting and, if applicable, the number of reentries on a Strategic Training Range.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign) VERIFY YOUR EXIT FIX ESTIMATE AND REQUESTED ALTITUDE AFTER EXIT,\nand if applicable,\nTHE NUMBER OF REENTRIES.\nForward estimates for exit/alternate exit fixes, requested altitude after exit, and, if applicable, the number of reentries on the Strategic Training Range.\nApply the procedures of paragraph 6-1-2, Nonreceipt of Position Report, based upon the pilot's estimate for the route exit fix.\nClearance may be issued to amend or restrict operations on a route for ATC considerations. Where a route has been designated MARSA in accordance with subparagraph c, ATC must not amend or restrict operations in such a manner as to compromise MARSA provisions.\nNOTE-\nWhen MARSA is provided through route scheduling and circumstances prevent the pilot from entering the route within established time limits, it must be the responsibility of the pilot to inform the ATC facility and advise his/her intentions.\nIf an aircraft on an IR experiences a two‐way radio communications failure and you are unable to determine if the aircraft is proceeding VFR in accordance with 14 CFR section 91.185(b) or the aircraft has not been positively radar identified:\nProvide separation to the destination airport based on the aircraft complying with the following:\nMaintain to the exit/alternate exit fix the higher of the following altitudes:\nThe minimum IFR altitude for each of the remaining route segment(s) remaining on the route.\nThe highest altitude assigned in the last ATC clearance.\nDepart the exit/alternate exit fix at the appropriate altitude specified in subparagraph (a) above, then climb/descend to the altitude filed in the flight plan for the remainder of the flight, or\nNOTE-\nIn the event of a two‐way communications failure, ATC will be based on the following anticipated pilot action at the exit fix. Unless otherwise covered in a letter of agreement, and if the pilot is unable to comply with the VFR provisions of 14 CFR section 91.185/FLIP IFR Supplement, the pilot will exercise his/her emergency authority, squawk transponder Code 7700, depart the exit/alternate exit fix and climb/descend (continuing to squawk 7700) to the altitude filed in the flight plan. Subsequent transponder operations will be in accordance with paragraph 10-4-4, Communications Failure. Air traffic controller action from the exit fix is as prescribed in paragraph 10-1-1, Emergency Determinations.\nProceed in accordance with the lost communication procedure contained in letters of agreement.\nContinue to monitor the last ATC assigned discrete code.\nNOTE-\nPilots who experience a two‐way radio failure will adjust their transponder to Code 7700 during climb/descent to altitude filed for the next leg of the flight plan; then change to Code 7600 for a period of 15 minutes. At the end of each 15-minute period, he/she will squawk 7700 for a period of 1 minute; all other times he/she will squawk 7600.\nImpose delays, if needed, to eliminate conflict with nonparticipating IFR aircraft when necessary to preclude denial of IR usage. Advise the pilot of the expected length and reason for delay.\nINTERCEPTOR OPERATIONS\nProvide maximum assistance to expedite the movement of interceptor aircraft on active air defense (scrambles) missions until the unknown aircraft is identified in accordance with the policies and procedures published in FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations.\nNOTE-\nThe FAA and the military have mutually agreed to the implementation of policies and procedures for control of air defense interceptor operations. Effective coordination and cooperation between FAA and the military at all levels are essential if policy objectives are to be met.\nThe ADCF initiating the SCRAMBLE must identify the mission as an active air defense mission.\nATC services must be used for active air defense missions insofar as the circumstances and situation permits.\nUpon request, the ATC facility must expedite transfer of the control jurisdiction of the interceptors to the requesting ADCF.\nSPECIAL INTEREST SITES\nImmediately relay any reports or information regarding unusual aircraft activities in the vicinity of special interest sites such as nuclear power plants, power plants, dams, refineries, etc., to supervisory/CIC personnel.\nNOTE-\nAir traffic controllers have no responsibilities to monitor or observe aircraft in the vicinity of special interest sites unless directed by supervisory/CIC personnel.\nSPECIAL AIR TRAFFIC RULES (SATR) AND SPECIAL FLIGHT RULES AREA (SFRA)\nThe Code of Federal Regulations prescribes special air traffic rules for aircraft operating within the boundaries of certain designated airspace. These areas are listed in 14 CFR part 93 and can be found throughout the NAS. Procedures, nature of operations, configuration, size, and density of traffic vary among the identified areas.\nSpecial Flight Rules Areas are areas of airspace wherein the flight of aircraft is subject to special air traffic rules set forth in 14 CFR part 93, unless otherwise authorized by air traffic control. Not all areas listed in 14 CFR part 93 are Special Flight Rules Areas, but special air traffic rules apply to all areas designated as SFRA.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR Part 93, Special Air Traffic Rules.\nP/CG Term - SPECIAL AIR TRAFFIC RULES (SATR).\nP/CG Term - SPECIAL FLIGHT RULES AREA (SFRA).\nEach person operating an aircraft to, from, or within airspace designated as a SATR area or SFRA must adhere to the special air traffic rules set forth in 14 CFR part 93, as applicable, unless otherwise authorized or required by ATC.\nATC SECURITY SERVICES FOR THE WASHINGTON, DC, SPECIAL FLIGHT RULES AREA (DC SFRA)\nProvide ATC security services at locations where procedures are required for tracking aircraft in security services airspace. ATC security services are designed to support the national security mission of the FAA and other agencies. Two‐way radio communications, flight planning, and an operational transponder on an assigned code are required for operations in the designated area.\nWhen the assigned code is observed, advise the aircraft to proceed on course/as requested but to remain outside of Class B, C, and/or D airspace as appropriate.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(ACID) TRANSPONDER OBSERVED PROCEED ON COURSE/AS REQUESTED; REMAIN OUTSIDE (class) AIRSPACE.\nMaintain continuous security tracking of VFR aircraft operating in the designated area to assist security forces in situational awareness. Immediately report all instances of loss of radio communication or the inability to conduct security tracking of an aircraft to the operations supervisor (OS)/CIC and wait for instructions.\nBasic separation services to aircraft, for example, IFR, SVFR, Class B, Class C, TRSA, do not apply to ATC security tracking.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 9-2-10, Washington, DC, Special Flight Rules Area (DC SFRA)/ATC Security Services (9-27-2016)\nAircraft with operating transponders, but without operating Mode C (altitude), require specific authorization from ATC to operate in the SFRA. ATC must coordinate with the Domestic Events Network (DEN) before approval.\nAircraft flying too low for radar coverage must be instructed to report landing or exiting the SFRA. Keep flight progress strips on these aircraft until pilot reports landing or exiting the SFRA. If a flight progress strip does not exist for the aircraft, record the call sign, transponder code, entry point (for example, north, northeast, east), and time of entry into the SFRA.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign), REPORT LANDING OR LEAVING THE SFRA.\nUnited States military, law enforcement, and aeromedical flights are exempt from filing flight plans.\nEstablishing two‐way Communications.\nPilots must establish two‐way radio communications with ATC prior to entering the security service area. Responding to a radio call with, “(a/c call sign) standby,” establishes radio communications and the pilot may enter the area, provided all other security requirements have been satisfied.\nAircraft requesting security services should not normally be held. However, if holding is necessary or workload/traffic conditions prevent immediate provision of ATC security services, inform the pilot to remain outside the designated area until conditions permit the provision of ATC security services. Inform the pilot of the expected length of delay.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(A/C call sign) REMAIN OUTSIDE OF THE (location) AND STANDBY. EXPECT (time) MINUTES DELAY.\nTermination of Service.\nIf the aircraft is not landing within the designated area, provide security services until the aircraft exits the area and then advise the aircraft to squawk VFR and that frequency change is approved.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK VFR, FREQUENCY CHANGE APPROVED.\nor\nCONTACT (facility identification).\nWhen an aircraft is landing at an airport inside the area, instruct the pilot to remain on the assigned transponder code until after landing.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(ACID) REMAIN ON YOUR ASSIGNED TRANSPONDER CODE UNTIL YOU LAND, FREQUENCY CHANGE APPROVED.\nUsing approved handoff functionality, transfer the data blocks of all security tracked aircraft that will enter another sector/position for coordination of aircraft information/location. Upon acceptance of the transferred information, instruct the pilot to contact the next sector/positions' frequency.\nSECURITY NOTICE (SECNOT)\nUpon receiving notification of a SECNOT, the controller must forward all information on the subject aircraft to the OS/CIC. If information is not known, broadcast call sign on all frequencies and advise the OS/CIC of the response.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - SECURITY NOTICE.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 20, Section 9, Security Notice (SECNOT).\nLAW ENFORCEMENT AND SENSITIVE GOVERNMENT MISSIONS\nProvide the maximum assistance possible to law enforcement aircraft when requested.\nIf requested by the pilot/flight crew, communicate with law enforcement aircraft on a separate and unique communications frequency whenever possible.\nEnsure assistance to law enforcement aircraft does not compromise approved separation minima or place the aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions or other aircraft.\nWhen requested, assist law enforcement in locating suspect aircraft.\nForward any information received pertaining to stolen aircraft to the OS/CIC for reporting on the Domestic Events Network (DEN).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-7-7, Cooperation With Law Enforcement Agencies.\nSensitive government missions.\nSensitive government missions include inflight identification, surveillance, interdiction and pursuit activities conducted by government aircraft for national defense, homeland security, and intelligence or law enforcement purposes.\nProvide support to national security and homeland defense activities as specified in paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority.\nTo facilitate accomplishment of sensitive government missions, exemptions from specified parts of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations have been granted to designated departments and agencies. Each organization's exemption identifies its responsibilities for notifying ATC of its intent to operate under an exemption before commencing operations.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 19-3-1, Authorizations and Exemptions from Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).\nDepartments and agencies that conduct sensitive government missions are assigned U.S. special call signs. Additionally, some have pre-assigned beacon codes to permit them to apprise ATC of ongoing mission activities and solicit air traffic assistance. To support these sensitive government missions, ATC must:\nNot change the sensitive beacon codes requested or displayed by these operators.\nTo the maximum extent possible, ensure the full call sign designator of aircraft conducting sensitive government operations is entered into FAA automation systems.\nNot alter or abbreviate the U.S. special call signs used by aircraft for sensitive government operations.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.67, Air Traffic Management Security Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations.\nMILITARY AERIAL REFUELING\nAuthorize aircraft to conduct aerial refueling along published or special tracks at their flight plan altitudes, unless otherwise requested.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO CONDUCT REFUELING ALONG (number) TRACK,\nor\nFROM (fix) TO (fix),\nand\nMAINTAIN BLOCK (altitude) THROUGH (altitude),\nor\nCOMMENCING AT (altitude), DESCENDING TO (altitude).\nNOTE-\nDuring aerial refueling, tanker aircraft are responsible for receiver aircraft communication with ATC and for their navigation along the track.\nAerial refueling airspace is not sterilized airspace and other aircraft may transit this airspace provided vertical or lateral separation is provided from refueling aircraft.\nMARSA begins between the tanker and receiver when the tanker and receiver(s) have entered the air refueling airspace and the tanker advises ATC that he/she is accepting MARSA.\nMARSA ends between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises ATC that the tanker and receiver aircraft are vertically positioned within the air refueling airspace and ATC advises MARSA is terminated.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-11, Use of MARSA.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-8, Additional Separation for Formation Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 5, Aerial Refueling.\nProvide radar assistance to the rendezvous for participating aircraft:\nWhen requested, and\nBy providing vertical separation prior to MARSA declaration.\nDo not request receiver aircraft that have been cleared to conduct air refueling and have departed the ARIP to:\nMake code changes when less than 5 miles from the tanker.\nSquawk standby when less than 1 mile or more than 3 miles from the tanker.\nNOTE-\nRequests for receiver aircraft to make code changes during air refueling diverts the receiver pilot's attention during a critical phase of flight.\nWhen issuing an initial air refueling clearance, you may request a receiver to squawk standby when the receiver reaches a point 3 miles from the tanker.\nNOTE-\nReceiver aircraft will squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.\nOnce rendezvous is completed, heading and altitude assignments may be made with the tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.\nUpon rendezvous completion, the tanker must keep receiver aircraft within 3 miles of the tanker until MARSA is terminated.\nAfter MARSA has been declared, you should avoid issuing course or altitude changes prior to rendezvous.\nNOTE-\nAltitude or course changes issued will automatically void MARSA.\nDo not use the altitude vacated during the refueling operation until the refueling aircraft has reported reaching the next IFR altitude.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 6-6-2, Exceptions.\nApprove requests by the tanker pilot for vectors or alternative routes or altitudes as follows:\nFurnish vectors or alternative altitudes at any time.\nFurnish nonradar routes only after the refueling aircraft have passed the ARCP.\nNOTE-\nTo meet a training requirement that aerial refueling be accomplished in a nonradar environment, the military has requested that vectors be furnished only upon request.\nThe tanker commander is responsible for coordinating all inflight requests with other aircraft in the refueling mission before submission of such requests to the center.\nNormally, aircraft conducting aerial refueling operations will utilize at least three consecutive altitudes.\nUnless a vector or alternative route has been furnished, clear the aircraft to depart the refueling track at a navigational reference point or egress fix.\nRequest an aircraft to report the ARIP, ARCP, or egress fix as necessary.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT:\nA-R-I-P,\nor\nA-R-C-P,\nor\nEGRESS FIX.\nExpect the following procedures in addition to those required by the appropriate parts of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations in the event of two‐way communications failure:\nThe tanker will depart the track from the highest altitude in the block.\nThe receiver will depart the track from the lowest altitude in the block.\nAircraft will squawk 7600 for at least 2 minutes prior to departing the track.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-14, Military Operations Above FL 600.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS ABOVE FL 600\nControl aircraft operating above FL 600 using the following procedures:\nFlight plans involving supersonic flight are required 16 hours in advance of proposed departure times for processing and approval by the ARTCCs concerned. The originating ARTCC, where the flight plan is first filed, may waive the 16-hour advance filing requirement.\nThe route of flight must be defined by at least one high altitude fix within each ARTCC area without regard to the distance between fixes. Additionally, the entry and exit points of turns of 90 degrees or more will be designated.\nElapsed times from takeoff to the first fix in each ARTCC area must be included in the route of flight.\nThe ARTCC which originates the flight plan must forward departure times to all ARTCCs responsible for processing the flight plan.\nApproval of the flight plan indicates approval of both route and flight levels (if stated) including operations below FL 600 (aerial refueling).\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED AS FILED VIA ROUTE AND FLIGHT LEVELS.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-13, Military Aerial Refueling.\nSeparation. Use the following as minima in lieu of the corresponding type of separation prescribed in:\nNOTE-\nThe primary method described to provide separation between two supersonic aircraft is to descend the aircraft at the lower FL and provide vertical separation since the aircraft at the higher FL may not be able to climb rapidly enough to establish the required separation. Another aspect which should be considered is that supersonic aircraft during turns, either programmed or as the result of vectors, will lose a few thousand feet. Vectoring supersonic aircraft seriously affects the range and mission objectives. Radar separation is the preferred method of separating a subsonic aircraft both from another subsonic aircraft or from a supersonic aircraft.\nParagraph 4-5-1, Vertical Separation Minima: 5,000 feet.\nNOTE-\nThe security requirements of the military services preclude the transmission of actual altitude information on the air/ground or landline circuits. Altitude information for the day should be readily available to the controllers at their positions of operation. The classification requirements of the altitude information remains unchanged.\nPilots will report their altitude, using the coded plan, and intended flight profile on initial contact with each ARTCC.\nParagraph 6-5-4, Minima Along Other Than Established Airways or Routes: Protect the airspace 25 miles either side of the route centerline. For turns by supersonic aircraft, protect the airspace 75 miles on the overflown side and 25 miles on the other side. For turns by subsonic aircraft, protect the airspace 34 miles on the overflown side and 25 miles on the other side.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-3, Abbreviated Departure Clearance.\nMILITARY SPECIAL USE FREQUENCIES\nAssign special use frequency to:\nNOTE-\nSpecial use frequencies are assigned to ARTCCs in such a manner that adjacent ARTCCs will not have the same frequency. They are to be used within the ARTCC area jurisdiction from the established FL base of the high altitude sectors and above. Each high altitude sector should have the capability to use the special use frequency on a shared basis.\nUSAF, U.S. Navy, and Air National Guard (ANG) single‐pilot jet aircraft formations operating at night or in instrument weather conditions. Formations of five or more USAF aircraft deploying either to a continental U.S. staging base or nonstop to an overseas location are authorized to use special use frequencies at any time. Normally these deployments will be conducted within an altitude reservation.\nU-2 and B-57 (pressure suit flights) aircraft at all altitudes/FLs except where terminal operations require the assignment of other frequencies.\nNOTE-\nAerial refueling operations may require that aircraft leave the special use frequency for communications with the tanker. This will occur when the receiver is approximately 200 miles from the ARCP. The tanker aircraft will remain on the ARTCC assigned frequency and will relay clearances to the receiver as required. An alternate means of communications between the tanker and receiver is HF radio.\nAll aircraft during supersonic flight.\nNOTE-\nPilots are expected to request assignment of the special use frequency in the remarks section of the flight plan or before entering supersonic flight. B-57 aircraft engaged in pressure suit operations will use the static call sign KITE and flights will normally be conducted from Dover, Eielson, Ellington, Hickman, Howard, Kirtland, and McClellan Air Force Bases.\nE-3A AWACS mission crews when operations are being conducted as an MRU in accordance with appropriate letters of agreement.\nThe special use frequency may be assigned as “backup” for the high‐altitude sector when direct communications are essential because of a potential emergency control situation.\nDo not assign the special use frequency to the aircraft in subparagraph a1 above, when they will operate in airspace assigned for special military operations.\nAVOIDANCE OF AREAS OF NUCLEAR RADIATION\nAdvise pilots whenever their proposed flight path will traverse a reported or forecasted area of hazardous radiation and reroute the aircraft when requested by the pilot.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 4-4-4, Avoidance of Hazardous Radiation Areas.\nInform pilots when an airfield of intended landing lies within a reported or forecasted area of hazardous radiation and request the pilot to advise his/her intentions.\nSAMP FLIGHTS\nProvide special handling to USAF or other government aircraft using the “SAMP” call sign and engaged in aerial sampling/surveying missions for nuclear, chemical, or hazardous material contamination. Approve inflight clearance requests for altitude and route changes to the maximum extent possible. Other IFR aircraft may be recleared so that requests by SAMP aircraft are approved.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 4-4-4, Avoidance of Hazardous Radiation Areas.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-3-2, Aerial Sampling/Surveying for Airborne Contamination.\nAWACS/NORAD SPECIAL FLIGHTS\nDo not delay E-3 AWACS aircraft identified as “AWACS/NORAD Special” flights. The following control actions are acceptable while expediting these aircraft to the destination orbit.\nEn route altitude changes +/- 2,000 feet from the requested flight level.\nRadar vectors or minor route changes that do not impede progress towards the destination orbit.\nNOTE-\nNORAD has a requirement to position E-3 AWACS aircraft at selected locations on a time‐critical basis. To the extent possible these flights will utilize routes to the destination orbit that have been precoordinated with the impacted ATC facilities. To identify these flights, the words “AWACS/NORAD SPECIAL” will be included as the first item in the remarks section of the flight plan.\nWEATHER RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHTS\nTEAL and NOAA mission aircraft fly reconnaissance flights to gather meteorological data on winter storms, (NWSOP missions), hurricanes and tropical cyclones (NHOP missions). The routes and timing of these flights are determined by movement of the storm areas and not by traffic flows.\nWhen a dropsonde release time is received from a TEAL or NOAA mission aircraft, workload and priorities permitting, controllers must advise the mission aircraft of any traffic estimated to pass through the area of the drop at altitudes below that of the mission aircraft. This traffic advisory must include:\nAltitude.\nDirection of flight.\nETA at the point closest to drop area (or at the fix/intersection where drop will occur).\nNOTE-\nA dropsonde is a 14-inch long cardboard cylinder about 2.75 inches in diameter, that weighs approximately 14 ounces (400 grams), and has a parachute attached. When released from the aircraft it will fall at a rate of approximately 2,500 feet per minute. Controllers should recognize that a dropsonde released at FL 310 will be a factor for traffic at FL 210 four minutes later. It is the aircraft commanders responsibility to delay release of dropsondes if traffic is a factor. Aircraft commanders will delay release of dropsondes based solely upon traffic as issued by ATC.\nWhen advised that an airborne TEAL or NOAA aircraft is requesting a clearance via CARCAH, issue the clearance in accordance with Chapter 4, IFR, Section 2, Clearances.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-1, Clearance Items.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-2, Clearance Prefix.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-3, Delivery Instructions.\nIf a TEAL or NOAA mission aircraft must be contacted but is out of VHF, UHF, and HF radio range, advise the supervisory traffic management coordinator-in-charge.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-3-4, Weather Reconnaissance Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nAircraft operations associated with a Weather Reconnaissance Area (WRA) must be conducted in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Aircraft Operations Center, U.S. Air Force Reserve Command 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, and the Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Organization in Support of the National Hurricane Operations Plan (FAA Order JO 7610.14, Appendix 3, Document 1), and the associated letters of agreement.\nEVASIVE ACTION MANEUVER\nApprove a pilot request to conduct an evasive action maneuver only on the basis of a permissible traffic situation. Specify the following items, as necessary, when issuing approval:\nNOTE-\nThe “evasive action” maneuver is performed by a bomber/fighter bomber aircraft at or above FL 250 along a 60 NM long segment of the flight plan route overlying a RBS or other site and includes:\nFlying a zigzag pattern on both the left and right side of the flight plan route centerline. Altitude deviations are made in conjunction with the lateral maneuvering.\nLateral deviations from the route centerline will not normally exceed 12 miles. Altitude variations must not exceed plus or minus 1,000 feet of the assigned flight level; i.e., confined within a 2,000 foot block.\nSpecific route segment on which the maneuver will take place.\nDistance of maximum route deviation from the centerline in miles.\nAltitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO CONDUCT EVASIVE ACTION\nMANEUVER FROM (fix) TO (fix),\nand\n(number of miles) EITHER SIDE OF CENTERLINE,\nand\nMAINTAIN (altitude) THROUGH (altitude),\nand\nCOMPLETE MANEUVER AT (fix) AT (altitude).\nNONSTANDARD FORMATION/CELL OPERATIONS\nOccasionally the military is required to operate in a nonstandard cell formation and controllers should be knowledgeable of the various tactics employed and the procedures used.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 3, Military Formation Flight.\nFormation leaders are responsible for obtaining ATC approval to conduct nonstandard formation/cell operations.\nWhen nonstandard formation/cell operations have been approved, controllers must assign sufficient altitudes to allow intra‐cell vertical spacing of 500 feet between each aircraft in the formation.\nControl nonstandard formation/cell operations on the basis that MARSA is applicable between the participating aircraft until they establish approved separation which is acknowledged by ATC.\nApply approved separation criteria between the approved nonstandard formation/cell envelope and nonparticipating aircraft.\nClear aircraft operating in a nonstandard formation/cell to the breakup fix as the clearance limit. Forward data pertaining to route or altitude beyond the breakup point to the center concerned as a part of the routine flight plan information.\nEN ROUTE. If the breakup occurs in your area, issue appropriate clearances to authorize transition from formation to individual routes or altitudes. If a breakup cannot be approved, issue an appropriate clearance for the flight to continue as a formation.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Unmanned Free BalloonsAPPLICATION\nFIG 9-6-1Shapes of 11 Million Cubic Feet Balloon\nat Various Altitudes\nApply the following procedures, as appropriate, when unmanned free balloons are within airspace for which you have control jurisdiction:\nNOTE-\nThese procedures apply to unmanned free balloons that carry payloads as described in 14 CFR section 101.1(a)(4). Payloads may weigh several hundred pounds and the physical shape of the balloons change at various altitudes/flight levels. (See FIG 9-6-1.) Balloon and payload ascend at an average rate of 400 feet a minute. Over the descent area, the payload is normally released from the balloon and descends by parachute at a minimum rate of 1,000 feet a minute. The balloon is normally deflated automatically when the payload is released. The operator is required to advise ATC 1 hour in advance of descent in accordance with 14 CFR section 101.39.\nPost the balloon flight on flight progress strips along the planned trajectory and revise routing as tracking/position reports require.\nNOTE-\nThe prelaunch notice information should be posted on flight progress strips for planning and operational purposes.\nRadar flight follow balloons to the extent that equipment capabilities permit. If radar flight following is not possible, tracking should be attempted by communication with the “chase plane,” telephone contact with the operator, pilot, or ground observation reports.\nNOTE-\nSome operators have equipped their balloons with transponder beacons in addition to a radar reflection device or material required by 14 CFR section 101.35, but at cruise altitude, the balloon's communications equipment and transponder, if so equipped, are operated intermittently to conserve battery energy.\nWith pilot concurrence, provide separation between aircraft and balloons when you are satisfied that the balloon information is sufficiently reliable to provide the service. Do not attempt to separate aircraft from the balloon by using vertical separation unless you have accurate balloon altitude information.\nProvide traffic advisories to all affected aircraft during initial contact specifying the balloon's known or estimated position, direction of movement, and altitude as “unknown” or “reported,” as appropriate.\nNOTE-\nUnless ATC requires otherwise, operators of unmanned free balloons are required to monitor the course of the balloon and record its position at least every two hours.

GeneralEMERGENCY DETERMINATIONS\nAn emergency can be either a Distress or an Urgency condition as defined in the “Pilot/Controller Glossary.”\nA pilot who encounters a Distress condition should declare an emergency by beginning the initial communication with the word “Mayday,” preferably repeated three times. For an Urgency condition, the word “Pan‐Pan” should be used in the same manner.\nIf the words “Mayday” or “Pan-Pan” are not used but you believe an emergency or an urgent situation exists, handle it as though it were an emergency.\nBecause of the infinite variety of possible emergency situations, specific procedures cannot be prescribed. However, when you believe an emergency exists or is imminent, select and pursue a course of action which appears to be most appropriate under the circumstances and which most nearly conforms to the instructions in this manual.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-6, IFR Military Training Routes.\nOBTAINING INFORMATION\nUse the information provided or solicit more information as necessary to assist the distressed aircraft. Provide assistance that is consistent with the requests of the pilot. If you believe an alternative course of action may prove more beneficial, transmit your recommendation(s) to the pilot.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR § 91.3, Responsibilities and authority of pilot in command.\nIf an emergency was declared by an Emergency Autoland system, the aircraft may transmit the following:\nCallsign.\nThat Emergency Autoland has been activated.\nPosition (mileage and direction) relative to a nearby airport.\nThe intended emergency landing airport and the planned landing runway.\nAn ETE to the emergency landing airport.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Aircraft, N123B, pilot incapacitation, 12 miles southwest of KOJC, landing KIXD airport. Emergency Autoland in 13 minutes on runway 36.”\nNOTE-\nSystem configurations may vary between manufacturers. All systems should be configured to transmit enough information for the controller to respond effectively to the emergency.\nIn the event of frequency congestion, an Emergency Autoland system may transmit on 121.5 or CTAF instead of the last assigned ATC frequency.\nPROVIDING ASSISTANCE\nProvide maximum assistance to aircraft in distress. Enlist the services of available radar facilities operated by the FAA, the military services, and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as their emergency services and facilities, when the pilot requests or when you deem necessary.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nRESPONSIBILITY\nIf you are in communication with an aircraft in distress, handle the emergency and coordinate and direct the activities of assisting facilities. Transfer this responsibility to another facility only when you feel better handling of the emergency will result.\nWhen you receive information about an aircraft in distress, forward detailed data to the center in whose area the emergency exists.\nNOTE-\nCenters serve as the central points for collecting information, for coordinating with SAR, and for conducting a communications search by distributing any necessary ALNOTs concerning:\nOverdue or missing IFR aircraft.\nAircraft in an emergency situation occurring in their respective area.\nAircraft on a combination VFR/IFR or an airfiled IFR flight plan and 30 minutes have passed since the pilot requested IFR clearance and neither communication nor radar contact can be established with it. For SAR purposes, these aircraft are treated the same as IFR aircraft.\nOverdue or missing aircraft which have been authorized to operate in accordance with special VFR clearances.\nNotifying the center about a VFR aircraft emergency allows provision of IFR separation if considered necessary.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-5, Emergency Situations.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-3-2, Information to be Forwarded to ARTCC.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-3-3, Information to be Forwarded to RCC.\nIf the aircraft involved is operated by a foreign air carrier, notify the center serving the departure or destination point, when either point is within the U.S., for relay to the operator of the aircraft.\nThe ARTCC must be responsible for receiving and relaying all pertinent ELT signal information to the appropriate authorities.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-10, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.\nWhen consideration is given to the need to escort an aircraft in distress, evaluate the close formation required by both aircraft. Special consideration should be given if the maneuver takes the aircraft through the clouds.\nBefore a determination is made to have an aircraft in distress be escorted by another aircraft, ask the pilots if they are familiar with and capable of formation flight.\nDo not allow aircraft to join up in formation during emergency conditions, unless:\nThe pilots involved are familiar with and capable of formation flight.\nThey can communicate with one another, and have visual contact with each other.\nIf there is a need for aircraft that are not designated as search and rescue aircraft to get closer to one another than radar separation standards allow, the maneuver must be accomplished, visually, by the aircraft involved.\nCOORDINATION\nCoordinate efforts to the extent possible to assist any aircraft believed overdue, lost, or in emergency status.\nAIRPORT GROUND EMERGENCY\nTERMINAL\nWhen an emergency occurs on the airport proper, control other air and ground traffic to avoid conflicts in the area where the emergency is being handled. This also applies when routes within the airport proper are required for movement of local emergency equipment going to or from an emergency which occurs outside the airport proper.\nNOTE-\nAircraft operated in proximity to accident or other emergency or disaster locations may cause hindrances to airborne and surface rescue or relief operations. Congestion, distraction or other effects, such as wake turbulence from nearby airplanes and helicopters, could prevent or delay proper execution of these operations.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 20, Temporary Flight Restrictions.\n14 CFR Section 91.137, Temporary Flight Restrictions.\nWorkload permitting, monitor the progress of emergency vehicles responding to a situation. If necessary, provide available information to assist responders in finding the accident/incident scene.\nINFLIGHT EMERGENCIES INVOLVING MILITARY FIGHTER‐TYPE AIRCRAFT\nThe design and complexity of military fighter‐type aircraft places an extremely high workload on the pilot during an inflight emergency. The pilot's full attention is required to maintain control of the aircraft. Therefore, radio frequency and transponder code changes should be avoided and radio transmissions held to a minimum, especially when the aircraft experiencing the emergency is at low altitude.\nPilots of military fighter-type aircraft, normally single engine, experiencing or anticipating loss of engine power or control may execute a flameout pattern in an emergency situation. Circumstances may dictate that the pilot, depending on the position and nature of the emergency, modify the pattern based on actual emergency recovery requirements.\nMilitary airfields with an assigned flying mission may conduct practice emergency approaches. Participating units maintain specific procedures for conducting these operations.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-13, Simulated Flameout (SFO) Approaches/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations/Practice Precautionary Approaches.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Emergency AssistanceINFORMATION REQUIREMENTS\nStart assistance as soon as enough information has been obtained upon which to act. Information requirements will vary, depending on the existing situation. Minimum required information for inflight emergencies is:\nNOTE-\nIn the event of an ELT signal see paragraph 10-2-10, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.\nAircraft identification and type.\nNature of the emergency.\nPilot's desires.\nAfter initiating action, obtain the following items or any other pertinent information from the pilot or aircraft operator, as necessary:\nNOTE-\nEmergency Autoland systems may not provide all of the required information for emergencies. Use the information provided to develop an appropriate course of action to assist the aircraft.\nIf an emergency has been declared by an Emergency Autoland system, transmissions to the aircraft may go unanswered.\nNormally, do not request this information from military fighter-type aircraft that are at low altitudes (for example, on approach, immediately after departure, on a low level route). However, request the position of an aircraft that is not visually sighted or displayed on radar if the location is not given by the pilot.\nAircraft altitude.\nFuel remaining in time.\nPilot reported weather.\nPilot capability for IFR flight.\nTime and place of last known position.\nHeading since last known position.\nAirspeed.\nNavigation equipment capability.\nNAVAID signals received.\nVisible landmarks.\nAircraft color.\nNumber of people on board.\nPoint of departure and destination.\nEmergency equipment on board.\nFREQUENCY CHANGES\nAlthough 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz are emergency frequencies, it might be best to keep the aircraft on the initial contact frequency. Change frequencies only when there is a valid reason.\nAIRCRAFT ORIENTATION\nOrientate an aircraft by the means most appropriate to the circumstances. Recognized methods include:\nRadar.\nNAVAIDs.\nPilotage.\nSighting by other aircraft.\nALTITUDE CHANGE FOR IMPROVED RECEPTION\nWhen you consider it necessary and if weather and circumstances permit, recommend that the aircraft maintain or increase altitude to improve communications or radar.\nNOTE-\nAircraft with high‐bypass turbofan engines (such as B747) encountering volcanic ash clouds have experienced total loss of power to all engines. Damage to engines due to volcanic ash ingestion increases as engine power is increased, therefore, climb while in the ash cloud is to be avoided where terrain permits.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 7-5-9, Flight Operations in Volcanic Ash.\nEMERGENCY SITUATIONS\nConsider that an aircraft emergency exists and inform the RCC or ARTCC if:\nNOTE-\nUSAF facilities are only required to notify the ARTCC.\nAn emergency is declared by any of the following:\nThe pilot.\nFacility personnel.\nOfficials responsible for the operation of the aircraft.\nA system-generated transmission from an aircraft.\nThere is unexpected loss of radar contact and radio communications with any IFR or VFR aircraft.\nReports indicate it has made a forced landing, is about to do so, or its operating efficiency is so impaired that a forced landing will be necessary.\nReports indicate the crew has abandoned the aircraft or is about to do so.\nAn emergency transponder code is displayed or reported.\nNOTE-\nEN ROUTE. ERAM: Code 7700 causes an emergency indicator to blink in the data block.\nIntercept or escort aircraft services are required.\nThe need for ground rescue appears likely.\nAn Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) signal is heard or reported.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-3, Providing Assistance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-10, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.\nHIJACKED AIRCRAFT\nHijack attempts or actual events are a matter of national security and require special handling.

If a frequency change is necessary, advise the pilot of the reason for the change, and request the aircraft contact the appropriate control facility. Inform that facility of the situation. If the aircraft is unable to communicate with the control facility, relay information and clearances.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nRADAR ASSISTANCE TO VFR AIRCRAFT IN WEATHER DIFFICULTY\nIf a VFR aircraft requests radar assistance when it encounters or is about to encounter IFR weather conditions, ask the pilot if he/she is qualified for and capable of conducting IFR flight.\nIf the pilot states he/she is qualified for and capable of IFR flight, request him/her to file an IFR flight plan and then issue clearance to destination airport, as appropriate.\nIf the pilot states he/she is not qualified for or not capable of conducting IFR flight, or if he/she refuses to file an IFR flight plan, take whichever of the following actions is appropriate:\nInform the pilot of airports where VFR conditions are reported, provide other available pertinent weather information, and ask if he/she will elect to conduct VFR flight to such an airport.\nIf the action in subparagraph 1 above is not feasible or the pilot declines to conduct VFR flight to another airport, provide radar assistance if the pilot:\nDeclares an emergency.\nRefuses to declare an emergency and you have determined the exact nature of the radar services the pilot desires.\nIf the aircraft has already encountered IFR conditions, inform the pilot of the appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude. If the aircraft is below appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude and sufficiently accurate position information has been received or radar identification is established, furnish a heading or radial on which to climb to reach appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nRADAR ASSISTANCE TECHNIQUES\nUse the following techniques to the extent possible when you provide radar assistance to a pilot not qualified to operate in IFR conditions:\nAvoid radio frequency changes except when necessary to provide a clear communications channel.\nMake turns while the aircraft is in VFR conditions so it will be in a position to fly a straight course while in IFR conditions.\nHave pilot lower gear and slow aircraft to approach speed while in VFR conditions.\nAvoid requiring a climb or descent while in a turn if in IFR conditions.\nAvoid abrupt maneuvers.\nVector aircraft to VFR conditions.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nEMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER (ELT) SIGNALS\nWhen an ELT signal is heard or reported:\nEN ROUTE. Notify the Rescue Coordination Center (RCC).\nNOTE-\nFAA Form 7210-8, ELT INCIDENT, contains standardized format for coordination with the RCC.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 9-3-1, FAA Form 7210-8, ELT Incident.\nTERMINAL. Notify the ARTCC which will coordinate with the RCC.\nNOTE-\nOperational ground testing of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) has been authorized during the first 5 minutes of each hour. To avoid confusing the tests with an actual alarm, the testing is restricted to no more than three audio sweeps.\nControllers can expect pilots to report aircraft position and time the signal was first heard, aircraft position and time the signal was last heard, aircraft position at maximum signal strength, flight altitude, and frequency of the emergency signal (121.5/243.0). (See AIM, paragraph 6-2-4, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT).)\nTERMINAL. Attempt to obtain fixes or bearings on the signal.\nSolicit the assistance of other aircraft known to be operating in the signal area.\nTERMINAL. Forward fixes or bearings and any other pertinent information to the ARTCC.\nNOTE-\nFix information in relation to a VOR or VORTAC (radial‐ distance) facilitates accurate ELT plotting by RCC and should be provided when possible.\nEN ROUTE. When the ELT signal strength indicates the signal may be emanating from somewhere on an airport or vicinity thereof, notify the on‐site technical operations personnel and the Regional Operations Center (ROC) for their actions. This action is in addition to the above.\nTERMINAL. When the ELT signal strength indicates the signal may be emanating from somewhere on the airport or vicinity thereof, notify the on‐site technical operations personnel and the ARTCC for their action. This action is in addition to the above.\nAir traffic personnel must not leave their required duty stations to locate an ELT signal source.\nNOTE-\nPortable handcarried receivers assigned to air traffic facilities (where no technical operations personnel are available) may be loaned to responsible airport personnel or local authorities to assist in locating the ELT signal source.\nEN ROUTE.

Notify the ARTCC if signal source is located/terminated.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-4, Responsibility.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-1, Information Requirements.\nAIRCRAFT BOMB THREATS\nWhen information is received from any source that a bomb has been placed on, in, or near an aircraft for the purpose of damaging or destroying such aircraft, notify your supervisor or the facility air traffic manager. If the threat is general in nature, handle it as a “Suspicious Activity.” When the threat is targeted against a specific aircraft and you are in contact with the suspect aircraft, take the following actions as appropriate:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Chapter 7, Procedures for Handling Suspicious Flight Situations and Hijacked Aircraft.\nAdvise the pilot of the threat.\nInform the pilot that technical assistance can be obtained from an FAA aviation explosives expert.\nNOTE-\nAn FAA aviation explosive expert is on call at all times and may be contacted by calling the FAA Operations Center, Washington, DC, Area Code 202-267-3333, ETN 521-0111, or DSN 851-3750. Technical advice can be relayed to assist civil or military air crews in their search for a bomb and in determining what precautionary action to take if one is found.\nAsk the pilot if he/she desires to climb or descend to an altitude that would equalize or reduce the outside air pressure/existing cabin air pressure differential. Issue or relay an appropriate clearance considering MEA, MOCA, MRA, and weather.\nNOTE-\nEqualizing existing cabin air pressure with outside air pressure is a key step which the pilot may wish to take to minimize the damage potential of a bomb.\nHandle the aircraft as an emergency and/or provide the most expeditious handling possible with respect to the safety of other aircraft, ground facilities, and personnel.\nNOTE-\nEmergency handling is discretionary and should be based on the situation. With certain types of threats, plans may call for a low‐key action or response.\nIssue or relay clearances to a new destination if requested.\nWhen a pilot requests technical assistance or if it is apparent that a pilot may need such assistance, do NOT suggest what actions the pilot should take concerning a bomb, but obtain the following information and notify your supervisor who will contact the FAA aviation explosives expert:\nNOTE-\nThis information is needed by the FAA aviation explosives expert so that he/she can assess the situation and make immediate recommendations to the pilot. The aviation explosives expert may not be familiar with all military aircraft configurations but he/she can offer technical assistance which would be beneficial to the pilot.\nType, series, and model of the aircraft.\nPrecise location/description of the bomb device if known.\nOther details which may be pertinent.\nNOTE-\nThe following details may be of significance if known, but it is not intended that the pilot should disturb a suspected bomb/bomb container to ascertain the information: The altitude or time set for the bomb to explode, type of detonating action (barometric, time, anti‐handling, remote radio transmitter), power source (battery, electrical, mechanical), type of initiator (blasting cap, flash bulb, chemical), and the type of explosive/incendiary charge (dynamite, black powder, chemical).\nWhen a bomb threat involves an aircraft on the ground and you are in contact with the suspect aircraft, take the following actions in addition to those discussed in the preceding paragraphs which may be appropriate:\nIf the aircraft is at an airport where tower control or FSS advisory service is not available, or if the pilot ignores the threat at any airport, recommend that takeoff be delayed until the pilot or aircraft operator establishes that a bomb is not aboard in accordance with 14 CFR part 121. If the pilot insists on taking off and in your opinion the operation will not adversely affect other traffic, issue or relay an ATC clearance.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR Section 121.538, Airplane Security.\nAdvise the aircraft to remain as far away from other aircraft and facilities as possible, to clear the runway, if appropriate, and to taxi to an isolated or designated search area. When it is impractical or if the pilot takes an alternative action; e.g., parking and off‐loading immediately, advise other aircraft to remain clear of the suspect aircraft by at least 100 yards if able.\nNOTE-\nPassenger deplaning may be of paramount importance and must be considered before the aircraft is parked or moved away from service areas. The decision to use ramp facilities rests with the pilot, aircraft operator/airport manager.\nIf you are unable to inform the suspect aircraft of a bomb threat or if you lose contact with the aircraft, advise your supervisor and relay pertinent details to other sectors or facilities as deemed necessary.\nWhen a pilot reports the discovery of a bomb or suspected bomb on an aircraft which is airborne or on the ground, determine the pilot's intentions and comply with his/her requests in so far as possible. Take all of the actions discussed in the preceding paragraphs which may be appropriate under the existing circumstances.\nThe handling of aircraft when a hijacker has or is suspected of having a bomb requires special considerations. Be responsive to the pilot's requests and notify supervisory personnel. Apply hijacking procedures and offer assistance to the pilot according to the preceding paragraphs, if needed.\nEXPLOSIVE DETECTION K-9 TEAMS\nTake the following actions should you receive an aircraft request for the location of the nearest explosive detection K-9 team.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-12, Explosives Detection K-9 Teams.\nObtain the aircraft identification and position and advise your supervisor of the pilot request.\nWhen you receive the nearest location of the explosive detection K-9 team, relay the information to the pilot.\nIf the aircraft wishes to divert to the airport location provided, obtain an estimated arrival time from the pilot and advise your supervisor.\nMANPADS ALERT\nWhen a threat or attack from Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) is determined to be real, notify and advise aircraft as follows:\nDo not withhold landing clearance. To the extent possible, issue information on MANPADS threats, confirmed attacks, or post-event activities in time for it to be useful to the pilot. The pilot or parent company will determine the pilot's actions.\nMANPADS information will be disseminated via the ATIS and/or controller-to-pilot transmissions.\nDisseminate via controller-to-pilot transmission until the appropriate MANPADS information is broadcast via the ATIS and pilots indicate they have received the appropriate ATIS code. MANPADS information will include nature and location of threat or incident, whether reported or observed and by whom, time (if known), and when transmitting to an individual aircraft, a request for pilot's intentions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATTENTION (aircraft identification), MANPADS ALERT. EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION. MANPADS THREAT/ATTACK/POST-EVENT ACTIVITY OBSERVED/ REPORTED BY (reporting agency) (location) AT (time, if known). (When transmitting to an individual aircraft) SAY INTENTIONS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention Eastern Four Seventeen, MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS threat reported by TSA, LaGuardia vicinity. Say intentions.”\n“Attention all aircraft, MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS post-event activity observed by tower south of airport at two-one-zero-zero Zulu.”\nReport MANPADS threat/attack/post-event activity via the ATIS and/or controller-to-pilot transmissions until notified otherwise by the Domestic Events Network (DEN) Air Traffic Security Coordinator (ATSC).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-10, Handling MANPADS Incidents.\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 3-1-3, Responsibilities.\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION OF AIRCRAFT\nWhen a laser event is reported to an air traffic facility, broadcast on all appropriate frequencies a general caution warning every five minutes for 20 minutes following the last report.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION EVENT, (location), (altitude).\nTerminal facilities must include reported unauthorized laser illumination events on the ATIS broadcast for one hour following the last report. Include the time, location, altitude, color, and direction of the laser as reported by the pilot.\nNOTE-\nAll personnel can expect aircrews to regard lasers as an inflight emergency and may take evasive action to avoid laser illumination. Additionally, other aircraft may request clearance to avoid the area.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-30, Reporting Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\nEMERGENCY AIRPORT RECOMMENDATION\nConsider the following factors when recommending an emergency airport:\nRemaining fuel in relation to airport distances.\nWeather conditions.\nNOTE-\nDepending on the nature of the emergency, certain weather phenomena may deserve weighted consideration when recommending an airport; e.g., a pilot may elect to fly farther to land at an airport with VFR instead of IFR conditions.\nAirport conditions.\nNAVAID status.\nAircraft type.\nPilot's qualifications.\nVectoring or homing capability to the emergency airport.\nNOTE-\nIn the event of an Emergency Autoland system activation, the system will select a suitable airport and advise ATC. The Emergency Autoland system does not consider closed runways, equipment on the runway, construction, or other possible airport hazards when selecting a suitable airport.\nConsideration to the provisions of subparagraph a and paragraph 10-2-16, Guidance to Emergency Airport, must be used in conjunction with the information derived from any automated emergency airport information source.\nGUIDANCE TO EMERGENCY AIRPORT\nWhen necessary, use any of the following for guidance to the airport:\nRadar.\nFollowing another aircraft.\nNAVAIDs.\nPilotage by landmarks.\nCompass headings.\nConsideration to the provisions of paragraph 10-2-15, Emergency Airport Recommendation, must be used in conjunction with the information derived from any automated emergency airport information source.\nEMERGENCY OBSTRUCTION VIDEO MAP (EOVM)\nThe EOVM is intended to facilitate advisory service to an aircraft in an emergency situation wherein an appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude cannot be maintained. It must only be used and the service provided under the following conditions:\nThe pilot has declared an emergency, or\nThe controller has determined that an emergency condition exists or is imminent because of the pilot's inability to maintain an appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude.\nNOTE-\nAppropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitudes may be defined as Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA), Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA), Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA), or Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA).\nWhen providing emergency vectoring service, the controller must advise the pilot that any headings issued are emergency advisories intended only to direct the aircraft toward and over an area of lower terrain/obstacle elevation.\nNOTE-\nAltitudes and obstructions depicted on the EOVM are the actual altitudes and locations of the obstacle/terrain and contain no lateral or vertical buffers for obstruction clearance.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-8-4, Emergency Obstruction Video Map (EOVM).\nVOLCANIC ASH\nIf a volcanic ash cloud is known or forecast to be present:\nRelay all information available to pilots to ensure that they are aware of the ash cloud's position and altitude(s).\nSuggest appropriate reroutes to avoid the area of known or forecast ash clouds.\nNOTE-\nVolcanic ash clouds are not normally detected by airborne or air traffic radar systems.\nIf advised by an aircraft that it has entered a volcanic ash cloud and indicates that a distress situation exists:\nConsider the aircraft to be in an emergency situation.\nDo not initiate any climb clearances to turbine-powered aircraft until the aircraft has exited the ash cloud.\nDo not attempt to provide escape vectors without pilot concurrence.\nNOTE-\nThe recommended escape maneuver is to reverse course and begin a descent (if terrain permits). However, it is the pilot's responsibility to determine the safest escape route from the ash cloud.\nControllers should be aware of the possibility of complete loss of power to any turbine-powered aircraft that encounters an ash cloud.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-4, Altitude Change for Improved Reception.\nAIM, Para 7-5-9, Flight Operations in Volcanic Ash.\nREPORTING DEATH, ILLNESS, OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH RISK ON BOARD AIRCRAFT\nIf an air traffic controller receives a report of the death of person, an illness, and/or other public health risk obtain the following information and notify the operations manager in charge (OMIC)/operations supervisor (OS)/controller-in-charge (CIC) as soon as possible.\nCall sign.\nNumber of suspected cases of illness on board.\nNature of the illnesses or other public health risk, if known.\nNumber of persons on board.\nNumber of deaths, if applicable.\nPilot's intent (for example, continue to destination or divert).\nAny request for assistance (for example, needing emergency medical services to meet the aircraft at arrival).\nThe OMIC/OS/CIC must relay the information to the DEN as soon as possible.\nNOTE-\nIf the ATC facility is not actively monitoring the DEN or does not have a dedicated line to the DEN, they must call into the DEN directly via 844-432-2962 (toll free).\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, such as a situation requiring ATC intervention, follow-on coordination regarding the incident will not involve ATC frequencies.\nThe initial report to a U.S. ATC facility may be passed from a prior ATC facility along the route of flight.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-37, Reporting Death, Illness, or Other Public Health Risk On Board Aircraft.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Control ActionsTRAFFIC RESTRICTIONS\nIFR traffic which could be affected by an overdue or unreported aircraft must be restricted or suspended unless radar separation is used. The facility responsible must restrict or suspend IFR traffic for a period of 30 minutes following the applicable time listed in subparagraphs a through e:\nThe time at which approach clearance was delivered to the pilot.\nThe EFC time delivered to the pilot.\nThe arrival time over the NAVAID serving the destination airport.\nThe current estimate, either the control facility's or the pilot's, whichever is later, at:\nThe appropriate en route NAVAID or fix, and\nThe NAVAID serving the destination airport.\nThe release time and, if issued, the clearance void time.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-4, Departure Release, Hold for Release, Release Times, Departure Restrictions, and Clearance Void Times.\nLIGHTING REQUIREMENTS\nEN ROUTE. At nontower or non-FSS locations, request the airport management to light all runway lights, approach lights, and all other required airport lighting systems for at least 30 minutes before the ETA of the unreported aircraft until the aircraft has been located or for 30 minutes after its fuel supply is estimated to be exhausted.\nTERMINAL. Operate runway lights, approach lights, and all other required airport lighting systems for at least 30 minutes before the ETA of the unreported aircraft until the aircraft has been located or for 30 minutes after its fuel supply is estimated to be exhausted.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-4-1, Emergency Lighting.\nTRAFFIC RESUMPTION\nAfter the 30-minute traffic suspension period has expired, resume normal air traffic control if the operators or pilots of other aircraft concur. This concurrence must be maintained for a period of 30 minutes after the suspension period has expired.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-4, Departure Release, Hold for Release, Release Times, Departure Restrictions, and Clearance Void Times.\nCOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE\nTake the following actions, as appropriate, if two‐way radio communications are lost with an aircraft:\nNOTE-\nWhen an IFR aircraft experiences two‐way radio communications failure, air traffic control is based on anticipated pilot actions. Pilot procedures and recommended practices are set forth in the AIM, CFRs, and pertinent military regulations.\nShould the pilot of an aircraft equipped with a coded radar beacon transponder experience a loss of two‐way radio capability, the pilot can be expected to adjust the transponder to reply on Mode 3/A Code 7600.\nIn the event of lost communications with an aircraft under your control jurisdiction use all appropriate means available to reestablish communications with the aircraft. These may include, but are not limited to, emergency frequencies, NAVAIDs that are equipped with voice capability, FSS, New York Radio, San Francisco Radio, etc.\nNOTE-\nNew York Radio and San Francisco Radio are operated by Collins Aerospace (formerly ARINC, Incorporated) under contract with the FAA for communications services. These Radio facilities have the capability of relaying information to/from ATC facilities throughout the country.\nAircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) or selective calling (SELCAL) may be utilized to reestablish radio communications with suitably equipped aircraft. ACARS can be utilized by contacting San Francisco Radio at (800)-621-0140 or New York Radio at (800) 645-1095. Provide the aircraft call sign, approximate location, and contact instructions. In order to utilize the SELCAL system, the SELCAL code for the subject aircraft must be known. If the SELCAL code is not contained in the remarks section of the flight plan, contact the pertinent air carrier dispatch office to determine the code. Then contact San Francisco Radio (for aircraft over the Pacific, U.S. or Mexico) or New York Radio (for aircraft over the Atlantic, Gulf of America, or Caribbean) and provide the aircraft call sign, SELCAL code, approximate location, and contact instructions.\nBroadcast clearances through any available means of communications including the voice feature of NAVAIDs.\nNOTE-\nSome UHF equipped aircraft have VHF navigation equipment and can receive 121.5 MHz.\n“Any available means” includes the use of FSS and New York Radio or San Francisco Radio.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-2, Clearance Prefix.\nAttempt to re‐establish communication by having the aircraft use its transponder or make turns to acknowledge clearances and answer questions. Request any of the following in using the transponder:\nRequest the aircraft to reply Mode 3/A “IDENT.”\nRequest the aircraft to reply on Code 7600.\nRequest the aircraft to change to “stand‐by” for sufficient time for you to be sure that the lack of a target is the result of the requested action.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPLY NOT RECEIVED, (appropriate instructions).\n(Action) OBSERVED, (additional instructions/information if necessary).\nBroadcast a clearance for the aircraft to proceed to its filed alternate airport at the MEA if the aircraft operator concurs.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-4, Radio Failure.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-6, IFR Military Training Routes.\nIf radio communications have not been (re) established with the aircraft after 5 minutes, consider the aircraft's or pilot's activity to be suspicious and report it to the OS/CIC per FAA Order JO 7610.4, Chapter 7, Procedures for Handling Suspicious Flight Situations and Hijacked Aircraft, and paragraph 2-1-26f, Supervisory Notification, of this order.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Oceanic Emergency ProceduresAPPLICATION\nThe procedures in this section are to be used solely in oceanic airspace.\nPHASES OF EMERGENCY\nEmergency phases are described as follows:\nUncertainty phase (INCERFA). When there is concern about the safety of an aircraft or its occupants, an INCERFA exists:\nWhen communication from an aircraft has not been received within 30 minutes after the time a communication should have been received or after the time an unsuccessful attempt to establish communication with such aircraft was first made, whichever is earlier; or\nWhen an aircraft fails to arrive within 30 minutes after the time of arrival last estimated by the pilot or by the ATC units, whichever is later.\nAlert phase (ALERFA). When there is apprehension about the safety of an aircraft and its occupants, an ALERFA exists:\nFollowing the uncertainty phase when subsequent attempts to establish communications with the aircraft, or inquiries to other relevant sources have failed to reveal any information about the aircraft; or\nWhen information has been received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired but not to the extent that a forced landing is likely; or\nWhen communication from an aircraft has not been received within 60 minutes after the time a communication should have been received or after the time an unsuccessful attempt to establish communication with such aircraft was first made, whichever is earlier.\nDistress phase (DETRESFA). When there is reasonable certainty that the aircraft and its occupants are threatened by grave and imminent danger, a DETRESFA exists:\nFollowing the alert phase when further attempts to establish communications with the aircraft and more widespread inquiries are unsuccessful; or\nWhen the fuel on board is considered to be exhausted or to be insufficient for the aircraft to reach safety; or\nWhen information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired to the extent that a forced landing is likely; or\nWhen information is received or it is reasonably certain that the aircraft is about to make or has made a forced landing.\nALERTING SERVICE AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE\nProvide alerting service to:\nAll aircraft receiving ATC service;\nAll other aircraft which have filed a flight plan or which are otherwise known to the ATC unit; and\nAny aircraft known or believed to be the subject of unlawful interference.\nWhen alerting service is required, the responsibility for coordinating such service must, unless otherwise established by letter of agreement, rest with the facility serving the FIR or CTA:\nWithin which the aircraft was flying at the time of last air‐ground radio contact; or\nWhich the aircraft was about to enter if the last air‐ground contact was established at or close to the boundary; or\nWithin which the point of destination is located if the aircraft:\nWas not equipped with suitable two‐way radio communications equipment; or\nWas not under obligation to transmit position reports.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 8, Section 2, Coordination.\nThe responsible Area Control Center (ACC) must serve as the control point for:\nCollecting all information relevant to a state of emergency of an aircraft;\nForwarding that information to the appropriate RCC; and\nCoordinating with other facilities concerned.\nThe responsibility of the ACC to provide alerting service for military aircraft may be waived upon a written or recorded request from a military agency. In this case, the military request must state that the military agency assumes full responsibility for their aircraft while the aircraft are operating in the oceanic airspace.\nResponsibility to provide alerting service for flight operations conducted under the “due regard” or “operational” prerogative of military aircraft is assumed by the military. When “due regard” operations are scheduled to end with aircraft filed under ICAO procedures, the ACC may, if specified in a letter of agreement, assume responsibility for alerting service at proposed time filed.\nIn the event of INCERFA, ALERFA, or DETRESFA, notify the following:\nWhen practicable, the aircraft operator.\nThe appropriate RCC.\nAeronautical stations having en route communications guard responsibilities at the point of departure, along or adjacent to the route of flight, and at the destination.\nACCs having jurisdiction over the proposed route of flight from the last reported position to the destination airport.\nINCERFA, ALERFA, and DETRESFA messages must include the following information, if available, in the order listed:\nINCERFA, ALERFA, or DETRESFA according to the phase of the emergency.\nAgency and person originating the message.\nNature of the emergency.\nSignificant flight plan information.\nThe air traffic unit which made the last radio contact, the time, and the frequency used.\nThe aircraft's last position report, how it was received, and what facility received it.\nColor and distinctive marks of aircraft.\nAny action taken by reporting office.\nOther pertinent remarks.\nAn INCERFA phase ends with the receipt of any information or position report on the aircraft. Cancel the INCERFA by a message addressed to the same stations as the INCERFA message.\nAn ALERFA ends when:\nEvidence exists that would ease apprehension about the safety of the aircraft and its occupants; or\nThe concerned aircraft lands. Cancel the ALERFA message by a message addressed to the same stations as the ALERFA message.\nA DETRESFA ends when the:\nAircraft successfully lands; or\nRCC advises of a successful rescue; or\nRCC advises of termination of SAR activities. Cancel the DETRESFA by a message addressed to the same stations as the DETRESFA message.\nA separate chronological record should be kept on each ALERFA and DETRESFA together with a chart which displays the projected route of the aircraft, position reports received, route of interceptor aircraft, and other pertinent information.\nINFLIGHT CONTINGENCIES\nIf an aircraft over water requests weather, sea conditions, ditching information, and/or assistance from surface vessels, or if the controller feels that this information may be necessary for aircraft safety, it should be requested from the RCC. Also, an appropriate AMVER SURPIC should be asked for if requested by the aircraft or deemed beneficial by control personnel.\nNOTE-\nThe AMVER Center can deliver, in a matter of minutes, a SURPIC of vessels in the area of a SAR incident, including their predicted positions and their characteristics.\nIn all cases of aircraft ditching, the airspace required for SAR operations must be determined by the RCC. The ACC must block that airspace until the RCC advises the airspace is no longer required. An International Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) must be issued describing the airspace affected.\nThe following actions will be taken in the event an aircraft must make an emergency descent:\nIn the event an aircraft requests an emergency descent:\nIssue a clearance to the requested altitude if approved separation can be provided.\nAdvise the aircraft of the traffic, and request its intentions if traffic prevents an unrestricted descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATC ADVISES (aircraft identification) UNABLE TO APPROVE UNRESTRICTED DESCENT.\nTRAFFIC (traffic information).\nREQUEST INTENTIONS.\nIn the event an aircraft is making or will make an emergency descent without a clearance:\nAdvise other aircraft of the emergency descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATC ADVISES (aircraft identification/all aircraft) BE ALERT FOR EMERGENCY DESCENT IN THE VICINITY OF (latitude/longitude) FROM (altitude/FL) TO (altitude/FL).\nAdvise other aircraft when the emergency descent is complete.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Aircraft identification/all aircraft) EMERGENCY DESCENT AT (location) COMPLETED.\nUpon notification that an aircraft is making an emergency descent through other traffic, take action immediately to safeguard all aircraft concerned.\nWhen appropriate, broadcast by ATC communications, by radio navigation aids, and/or through aeronautical communication stations/services an emergency message to all aircraft in the vicinity of the descending aircraft. Include the following information:\nLocation of emergency descent.\nDirection of flight.\nType aircraft.\nRoute if appropriate.\nAltitude vacated.\nOther information.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft in the vicinity of Trout, a northbound D‐C Ten on A‐T‐S Route Alfa Seven Hundred is making an emergency descent from flight level three three zero.” (Repeat as you deem appropriate.)\nIf traffic conditions permit, provide traffic information to the affected aircraft.\nImmediately after an emergency broadcast or traffic information has been made, issue appropriate clearances or instructions, as necessary, to all aircraft involved.\nSERVICES TO RESCUE AIRCRAFT\nProvide IFR separation between the SAR and the aircraft in distress, except when visual or radar contact has been established by the search and rescue aircraft and the pilots of both aircraft concur, IFR separation may be discontinued.\nClear the SAR aircraft to a fixed clearance limit rather than to the aircraft in distress, which is a moving fix. Issue route clearances that are consistent with that of the distressed aircraft.\nAdvise the rescue aircraft, as soon as practicable, of any factors that could adversely affect its mission; e.g., unfavorable weather conditions, anticipated problems, the possibility of not being able to approve an IFR descent through en route traffic, etc.\nAdvise the appropriate rescue agency of all pertinent information as it develops.\nForward immediately any information about the action being taken by the RCC, other organizations, or aircraft to the aircraft concerned.\nAdvise the aircraft operator of the current status of the SAR operation as soon as practicable.\nSince prompt, correct, and complete information is the key to successful rescue operations, ensure that this information is swiftly and smoothly supplied to those organizations actively engaged in rescue operations.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

General ControlAPPLICATION\nWhere control responsibility within Canadian airspace has been formally delegated to the FAA by the Transport Canada Aviation Group, apply basic FAA procedures except for the Canadian procedures contained in this chapter.\nNOTE-\nIn 1985, the U.S. and Canada established an agreement recognizing the inherent safety of the ATC procedures exercised by the other country. This agreement permits the use of ATC procedures of one country when that country is exercising ATC in the airspace over the territory of the other country insofar as they are not inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the laws and regulations or unique operational requirements of the country over whose territory such airspace is located. Accordingly, this chapter was revised to include only those Canadian procedures that must be used because of a Canadian regulatory or unique operational requirement.\nAIRSPACE CLASSIFICATION\nClass A airspace. Controlled airspace within which only IFR flights are permitted. Airspace designated from the base of all controlled high level airspace up to and including FL 600.\nClass B airspace. Controlled airspace within which only IFR and Controlled VFR (CVFR) flights are permitted. Includes all controlled low level airspace above 12,500 feet ASL or at and above the minimum en route IFR altitude, (whichever is higher) up to but not including 18,000 feet ASL. ATC procedures pertinent to IFR flights must be applied to CVFR aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThe CVFR pilot is responsible to maintain VFR flight and visual reference to the ground at all times.\nClass C airspace. Controlled airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but VFR flights require a clearance from ATC to enter.\nClass D airspace. Controlled airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but VFR flights do not require a clearance from ATC to enter, however, they must establish two-way communications with the appropriate ATC agency prior to entering the airspace.\nClass E airspace. Airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but for VFR flight there are no special requirements.\nClass F airspace. Airspace of defined dimensions within which activities must be confined because of their nature, or within which limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or both. Special use airspace may be classified as Class F advisory or Class F restricted.\nClass G airspace. Uncontrolled airspace within which ATC has neither the authority nor responsibility for exercising control over air traffic.\nONE THOUSAND-ON-TOP\nClear an aircraft to maintain “at least 1,000 feet‐on‐top” in lieu of “VFR‐on‐top,” provided:\nThe pilot requests it.\nNOTE-\nIt is the pilot's responsibility to ensure that the requested operation can be conducted at least 1,000 feet above all cloud, haze, smoke, or other formation, with a flight visibility of 3 miles or more. A pilot's request can be considered as confirmation that conditions are adequate.\nThe pilot will not operate within Class A or Class B airspace.\nSEPARATION\nApply a lateral, longitudinal, or vertical separation minimum between aircraft operating in accordance with an IFR or CVFR clearance, regardless of the weather conditions.\nDEPARTURE CLEARANCE/COMMUNICATION FAILURE\nBase controller action regarding radio failures in Canadian airspace on the requirement for pilots to comply with Canadian Airspace Regulations, which are similar to 14 CFR section 91.185; however, the following major difference must be considered when planning control actions. Except when issued alternate radio failure instructions by ATC, pilots will adhere to the following: If flying a turbine‐powered (turboprop or turbojet) aircraft and cleared on departure to a point other than the destination, proceed to the destination airport in accordance with the flight plan, maintaining the last assigned altitude or flight level or the minimum en route IFR altitude, whichever is higher, until 10 minutes beyond the point specified in the clearance (clearance limit), and then proceed at altitude(s) or flight level(s) filed in the flight plan. When the aircraft will enter U.S. airspace within 10 minutes after passing the clearance limit, the climb to the flight planned border crossing altitude is to be commenced at the estimated time of crossing the Canada/U.S. boundary.\nPARACHUTE JUMPING\nDo not authorize parachute jumping without prior permission from the appropriate Canadian authority.\nNOTE-\nCanadian regulations require written authority from the Ministry of Transport.\nSPECIAL VFR (SVFR)\nNOTE-\nPilots do not have to be IFR qualified to fly SVFR at night, nor does the aircraft have to be equipped for IFR flight.\nWithin a control zone where there is an airport controller on duty, approve or refuse a pilot's request for SVFR on the basis of current or anticipated IFR traffic only. If approved, specify the period of time during which SVFR flight is permitted.\nWithin a control zone where there is no airport controller on duty, authorize or refuse an aircraft's request for SVFR on the basis of:\nCurrent or anticipated IFR traffic, and\nOfficial ceiling and visibility reports.\nCanadian SVFR weather minimums for:\nAircraft other than helicopters. Flight visibility (ground visibility when reported) 1 mile.\nHelicopters. Flight visibility (ground visibility when available) 1/2 mile.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

ERAM - En RouteDESCRIPTION\nEn Route Decision Support Tool (EDST) is an integrated function of ERAM that is used by the sector team in performing its strategic planning responsibilities. EDST uses current plan data, forecast winds, aircraft performance characteristics, and track data to derive expected aircraft trajectories, and to predict conflicts between aircraft and between aircraft and special use or designated airspace. It also provides trial planning and enhanced flight data management capabilities.\nNOTE-\nFor use by the EDST, the current plan is what the En Route Automation System (EAS) predicts an aircraft will fly. This may include clearances that have not yet been issued to the aircraft. Current plans are used to model a flight trajectory and, when applicable, for detecting conflicts.\nCONFLICT DETECTION AND RESOLUTION\nActively scan EDST information for predicted aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-airspace alerts.\nWhen a conflict probe alert is displayed, evaluate the alert and take appropriate action as early as practical, in accordance with duty priorities.\nPrioritize the evaluation and resolution of conflict probe alerts to ensure the safe, expeditious, and efficient flow of air traffic.\nNOTE-\nConflict probe alerts are based on approved radar separation. Conflict probe does not account for instances in which greater separation may be needed (e.g., non-standard formations, A380) or where reduced separation is permitted (e.g., 3 mile airspace).\nWhen a conflict probe alert is displayed and when sector priorities permit, give consideration to the following in determining a solution:\nSolutions that involve direct routing, altitude changes, removal of a flight direction constraint (i.e., inappropriate altitude for direction of flight), and/or removal of a static restriction for one or more pertinent aircraft.\nImpact on surrounding sector traffic and complexity levels, flight efficiencies, and user preferences.\nWhen the Stop Probe feature is activated for an aircraft, conflict probe for that aircraft must be restarted before transfer of control, unless otherwise coordinated.\nNOTE-\nThe requirement in subparagraph 13-1-2e does not apply to aircraft entering a non EDST facility.\nTRIAL PLANNING\nWhen EDST is operational at the sector and when sector priorities permit, use the trial plan capability to evaluate:\nSolutions to predicted conflicts.\nThe feasibility of granting user requests.\nThe feasibility of removing a flight direction constraint (i.e., inappropriate altitude for direction of flight) for an aircraft.\nThe feasibility of removing a static restriction for an aircraft.\nCONFLICT PROBE-BASED CLEARANCES\nWhen the results of a trial plan based upon a user request indicate the absence of alerts, every effort should be made to grant the user request, unless the change is likely to adversely affect operations at another sector.\nTHE AIRCRAFT LIST (ACL), DEPARTURE LIST (DL) AND FLIGHT DATA MANAGEMENT\nThe ACL must be used as the sector team's primary source of flight data.\nActively scan EDST to identify automated notifications that require sector team action.\nWhen an ACL or DL entry has a Remarks indication, the Remarks field of the flight plan must be reviewed. Changes to the Remarks field must also be reviewed.\nHighlighting an entry on the ACL or DL must be used to indicate the flight requires an action or special attention.\nThe Special Posting Area (SPA) should be used to group aircraft that have special significance (e.g., aircraft to be sequenced, air refueling missions, formations).\nSector teams must post flight progress strips for any nonradar flights.\nA flight progress strip must be posted for any flight plan not contained in the EAS.\nSector teams must post any flight progress strip(s) that are deemed necessary for safe or efficient operations. The sector team must comply with all applicable facility directives to maintain posted flight progress strips.\nThe Drop Track Delete option must be used in accordance with facility directives.\nMANUAL COORDINATION AND THE COORDINATION MENU\nWhere automated coordination with a facility is not available (e.g., an international facility, a VFR tower), use the Coordination Menu or a flight progress strip to annotate manual coordination status, in accordance with facility directives.\nWhen the Coordination Menu is used and the flight plan is subsequently changed, remove the yellow coding from the Coordination Indicator after any appropriate action has been taken.\nHOLDING\nFor flights in hold, use the Hold View, Hold Data Menu, hold message, a flight progress strip, or a facility approved worksheet, to annotate holding instructions, in accordance with facility directives.\nRECORDING OF CONTROL DATA\nAll control information not otherwise recorded via automation recordings or voice recordings must be manually recorded using approved methods.\nWhen a verbal point out has been approved, remove the yellow color coding on the ACL.\nWhen the ACL or DL Free Text Area is used to enter control information, authorized abbreviations must be used. You may use:\nThe clearance abbreviations authorized in TBL 13-1-1.\nTBL 13-1-1Clearance Abbreviations\nAbbreviation\nMeaning\nA\nCleared to airport (point of intended landing)\nB\nCenter clearance delivered\nC\nATC clears (when clearance relayed through non-ATC facility)\nCAF\nCleared as filed\nD\nCleared to depart from the fix\nF\nCleared to the fix\nH\nCleared to hold and instructions issued\nN\nClearance not delivered\nO\nCleared to the outer marker\nPD\nCleared to climb/descend at pilot's discretion\nQ\nCleared to fly specified sectors of a NAVAID defined in terms of courses, bearings, radials, or quadrants within a designated radius\nT\nCleared through (for landing and takeoff through intermediate point)\nV\nCleared over the fix\nX\nCleared to cross (airway, route, radial) at (point)\nZ\nTower jurisdiction\nThe miscellaneous abbreviations authorized in TBL 13-1-2.\nThe EDST equivalents for control information symbols authorized in TBL 13-1-3.\nPlain language markings when it will aid in understanding information.\nLocally approved abbreviations.\nWhen the ACL or DL Free Text Area is used to enter control information, the Free Text Area must remain open and visible.

Do not send/acknowledge ERT coding unless the sector has track control for the flight or it has been otherwise coordinated.\nRoute Action Notifications (RAN) such as ATC preferred routes or route processing errors must be amended at the first control position that displays the RAN unless verbally coordinated or as specified in appropriate facility directives. Do not remove RAN coding unless the sector has track control or it has been otherwise coordinated.\nCURRENCY OF TRAJECTORY INFORMATION\nThe sector team must perform automation entries in a timely manner.\nNOTE-\nConflict probe accuracy requires timely updates of data used to model each flight's trajectory. If this data is not current, the aircraft entries and notification of probe results for surrounding sectors and facilities, as well as the subject sector, may be misleading.\nData used to model an individual aircraft's trajectory includes route of flight, assigned and interim altitudes, application/removal of an adapted restriction for that flight, and aircraft type.\nAn exception to the requirement to enter or update interim altitudes may be authorized for certain ARTCC sectors if explicitly defined in an appropriate facility directive.\nNOTE-\nConflict probe accuracy in assigning alert notification is dependent upon entry/update of a flight's interim altitude.\nDELAY REPORTING\nAdhere to all applicable delay reporting directives.\nDelay information must be recorded. Delay information may be automatically recorded via use of the ERAM Hold Data Menu, ERAM Hold View, a hold message, or manually on flight progress strips or facility-approved worksheets, in accordance with the facility-defined standard.\nNOTE-\nWhen using the ERAM Hold Data Menu or Hold View, delays are automatically recorded when the aircraft is cleared out of hold.\nOVERDUE AIRCRAFT\nUpon receipt of the overdue aircraft notification take appropriate actions set forth in Chapter 10, Section 3, Overdue aircraft.\nNOTE-\nESDT overdue aircraft notification is based on radar track data. Updating an aircraft's route of fight will remove the overdue aircraft notification.\nUSE OF GRAPHICS PLAN DISPLAY (GPD)\nGraphic depictions of flight trajectories may be used only to aid in situational awareness and strategic planning.\nDo not use trajectory-based positions as a substitute for radar track position.\nDo not use trajectory-based altitude in lieu of Mode C for altitude confirmation.\nDo not use the GPD for radar identification, position information, transfer of radar identification, radar separation, correlation, or point outs.\nFORECAST WINDS\nIn the event that current forecast wind data are not available, continue use of conflict probe and trial planning with appropriate recognition that alert and trajectory data may be affected.\nINTERFACILITY CONNECTIVITY\nIn the event of a loss of connectivity to an adjacent ERAM facility, continue use of EDST with appropriate recognition that alert data may be affected.\nSURVEILLANCE AND FLIGHT DATA OUTAGES\nIn the event of a surveillance or flight data outage, electronic flight data may be used to support situational awareness while the facility transitions to alternate automation capabilities or non radar procedures.\nAIRSPACE CONFIGURATION ELEMENTS\nAirspace Configuration Elements are:\nSpecial Activity Airspace (SAA).\nAirport Stream Filters (ASF).\nAdapted restrictions.\nWhere assigned as a sector responsibility by facility directive, the sector team must update Airspace Configuration Elements to reflect current status.\nNOTE-\nUnless otherwise covered in an LOA or facility directive, activating or scheduling the SAA in the Airspace Status View does NOT constitute coordination for activation of airspace.\nFor Airspace Configuration Elements designated as a sector responsibility, notify the operations supervisor when the status of an Airspace Configuration Element has been modified.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

ATOP - Oceanic\nThe following procedures are applicable to the operation of the ATOP Oceanic Air Traffic Control (ATC) System.\nDESCRIPTION\nThe ATOP ATC System is utilized in designated en route/oceanic airspace. ATOP includes both surveillance and flight data processing, which provides the controllers with automated decision support tools to establish, monitor and maintain separation between aircraft, and aircraft to airspace and terrain.\nATOP capabilities include:\nMEARTS based radar surveillance processing.\nConflict Prediction and Reporting.\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast (ADS-B).\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance- Contract (ADS-C).\nController Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC).\nATS Interfacility Data Communications (AIDC).\nWeather Deviation Tool.\nAdditional Decision Support Tools used primarily for situational awareness.\nElectronic Flight Data including Electronic Flight Strips.\nCONFLICT DETECTION AND RESOLUTION\nThe controller must use the most accurate information available to initiate, monitor, and maintain separation.\nApply the following procedures in airspace where conflict probe is being utilized as a decision support tool:\nConflict Probe Results.\nControllers must assume that the conflict probe separation calculations are accurate.\nUnless otherwise prescribed in subparagraph a3, controllers must utilize the results from conflict probe to initiate and maintain the prescribed separation minima.\nConflict Resolution.\nWhen a controller is alerted to a conflict, which will occur in his/her sector, take the appropriate action to resolve the conflict.\nThe controller responsible for resolving a conflict must evaluate the alert and take appropriate action as early as practical, in accordance with duty priorities, alert priority, and operational considerations.\nUnless otherwise specified in facility directives, the controller must take immediate action to resolve any “red” conflicts.\nOverriding Conflict Probe.\nControllers must not override conflict probe except for the following situations:\nThe application of a separation standard not recognized by conflict probe listed in subparagraph a8(a), or as identified by facility directive.\nWhen action has been taken to resolve the identified conflict and separation has been ensured, or\nControl responsibility has been delegated to another sector or facility, or\nOther situations as specified in facility directives.\nControllers must continue to ensure that separation is maintained until the overridden conflict is resolved.\nUse of Probe when Issuing Clearances. Utilize conflict probe results when issuing a clearance to ensure that any potential conflict has been given thorough consideration.\nUse of Probe when Accepting Manual Transfers. Prior to manually accepting an aircraft transfer from an external facility ensure that the coordinated flight profile is accurately entered, conflict probe initiated and, if necessary, action is taken to resolve any potential conflicts.\nTrial Probe. The controller can utilize trial probe to assess whether there are any potential conflicts with a proposed clearance or when performing manual coordination.\nNOTE-\nOnce initiated, trial probe does not take into account any changes made to the proposed profile or to any other flight profile in the system. It is an assessment by conflict probe of the current situation at the time the controller enters the trial probe. A trial probe does not alleviate the controller from performing a conflict probe when issuing a clearance or accepting a transfer.\nSystem Unable to Perform Conflict Probe for a Specific Aircraft.\nIf a flight's profile becomes corrupted, conflict probe may not be able to correctly monitor separation for that flight. Take the necessary steps to correct an aircraft's flight plan when conflict probe could not be performed.\nIn addition, after verifying flight plan data accuracy, utilize other decision support tools to establish and maintain the appropriate separation minima until such time that conflict probe can be utilized.\nConflict Probe Limitations.\nConflict Probe does not support the following separation minima:\nSubparagraph 8-4-2a2 - Nonintersecting paths.\nSubparagraph 8-4-2d - Intersecting flight paths with variable width protected airspace.\nSubparagraph 8-4-3a - Reduction of Route Protected Airspace, below FL 240.\nSubparagraph 8-4-3b - Reduction of Route Protected Airspace, at and above FL 240.\nSubparagraph 8-4-4a1 - Same NAVAID: VOR/VORTAC/TACAN.\nSubparagraph 8-4-4a2 - Same NAVAID: NDB.\nSubparagraph 8-4-4c - Dead Reckoning.\nParagraph 8-5-4 - Same Direction.\nParagraph 8-8-5 - VFR Climb and Descent.\nAdditional Decision Support Tools: These support tools include: range/bearing, time of passing, intercept angle, the aircraft situation display (ASD) and electronic flight data.\nThe results provided by these additional decision support/controller tools can be used by the controller for maintaining situational awareness and monitoring flight profile information, and for establishing and maintaining separation standards not supported by probe, or when probe is unavailable.\nUnder no circumstances must the controller utilize any of the additional decision support tools to override probe results when the applicable separation standard is supported by probe and none of the other conditions for overriding probe apply.\nINFORMATION MANAGEMENT\nCurrency of Information: The sector team is responsible for ensuring that manually entered data is accurate and timely. Ensure that nonconformant messages are handled in a timely manner and that the flight's profile is updated as necessary.\nNOTE-\nConflict probe accuracy requires timely updates of data used to model each flight's trajectory. If this data is not current, the aircraft flight profile and probe results may be misleading.\nData Block Management.\nEnsure that the data block reflects the most current flight information and controller applied indicators as specified in facility directives.\nEnsure that appropriate and timely action is taken when a special condition code is indicated in the data block.\nElectronic Flight Strip Management.\nElectronic flight strips must be maintained in accordance with facility directives and the following:\nAnnotations. Ensure that annotations are kept up to date.\nReduced Separation Flags. Ensure the flags listed below are selected appropriately for each flight:\nM- Mach Number Technique (MNT).\nR- Reduced MNT.\nD- Distance-based longitudinal.\nW- Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM).\nDegraded RNP. Select when an aircraft has notified ATC of a reduction in navigation capability that affects the applicable separation minima.\nRestrictions. Ensure restrictions accurately reflect the cleared profile.\nQueue Management.\nManage all sector and coordination queues in accordance with the appropriate message priority and the controller's priority of duties.\nIn accordance with facility directives, ensure that the messages directed to the error queue are processed in a timely manner.\nWindow/List Management.\nEnsure that the situation display window title bar is not obscured by other windows and/or lists.\nNOTE-\nThe title bar changes color to denote when priority information on the ASD is being obscured or is out of view.\nIn accordance with facility directives, ensure that designated windows and/or lists are displayed at all times.\nCONTROLLER PILOT DATA LINK COMMUNICATIONS (CPDLC)\nMeans of communication.\nWhen CPDLC is available and CPDLC connected aircraft are operating outside of VHF coverage, CPDLC must be used as the primary means of communication.\nVoice communications may be utilized for CPDLC aircraft when it will provide an operational advantage and/or when workload or equipment capabilities demand.\nWhen CPDLC is being utilized, a voice backup must exist (e.g., HF, SATCOM, Third party).\nWhen a pilot communicates via CPDLC, the response should be via CPDLC.\nTo the extent possible, the CPDLC message set should be used in lieu of free text messages.\nNOTE-\nThe use of the CPDLC message set ensures the proper “closure” of CPDLC exchanges.\nTransfer of Communications to the Next Facility.\nWhen the receiving facility is capable of CPDLC communications, the data link transfer is automatic and is accomplished within facility adapted parameters.\nWhen a receiving facility is not CPDLC capable, the transfer of communications must be made in accordance with local directives and Letters of Agreement (LOAs).\nAbnormal conditions.\nIf any portion of the automated transfer fails, the controller should attempt to initiate the transfer manually. If unable to complete the data link transfer, the controller should advise the pilot to log on to the next facility and send an End Service (EOS) message.\nIf CPDLC fails, voice communications must be utilized until CPDLC connections can be reestablished.\nIf the CPDLC connection is lost on a specific aircraft, the controller should send a connection request message (CR1) or advise the pilot via backup communications to log on again.\nIf CPDLC service is to be canceled, the controller must advise the pilot as early as possible to facilitate a smooth transition to voice communications. Workload permitting, the controller should also advise the pilot of the reason for the termination of data link.\nWhen there is uncertainty that a clearance was delivered to an aircraft via CPDLC, the controller must continue to protect the airspace associated with the clearance until an appropriate operational response is received from the flight crew. If an expected operational response to a clearance is not received, the controller will initiate appropriate action to ensure that the clearance was received by the flight crew. On initial voice contact with aircraft preface the message with the following:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call Sign) CPDLC Failure, (message).\nWEATHER DEVIATION TOOL\nThe weather deviation tool adds an additional converging, diverging, and intersecting (CDI) mileage buffer to the required separation calculated by ATOP when RNP distance‐based longitudinal separation is being applied.\nDeviation monitor window pink advisories require further evaluation before approving a weather deviation clearance.\nA pink advisory in the deviation monitor window with a zero or positive value in the +/- column indicates that the aircraft pair is either at or close to the required spacing.\nNOTE-\nThe CDI mileage buffer is enforced by ATOP conflict probe.\nATOP enforces an increased ADS-C reporting rate of 64 seconds.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 8-7-3, Longitudinal Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 8-8-3, Longitudinal Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 8-9-3, Longitudinal Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 8-10-3, Longitudinal Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 13-2-2, Conflict Detection and Resolution.\nCOORDINATION\nIn addition to the requirements set forth in Chapter 8, Offshore/Oceanic Procedures, Section 2, Coordination, automated coordination must constitute complete coordination between ATOP sectors, both internally and between sectors across adjacent ATOP facilities, except:\nWhen the aircraft is in conflict with another in the receiving sector, or\nWhen otherwise specified in facility directives or LOA.\nTEAM RESPONSIBILITIES - MULTIPLE PERSON OPERATION\nWhen operating in a multiple controller operation at a workstation, ensure all ATC tasks are completed according to their priority of duties.\nMultiple controller operation must be accomplished according to facility directives.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Standard Operating Practice (SOP) for the Transfer of Position Responsibility\nPURPOSEThis appendix prescribes the method and step-by-step process for conducting a position relief briefing and transferring position responsibility from one specialist to another.\nDISCUSSIONIn all operational facilities, the increase in traffic density and the need for the expeditious movement of traffic without compromising safety have emphasized the importance of the position relief process.The contents, methods, and practices used for position relief and briefings vary among personnel, and pertinent information is often forgotten or incompletely covered. Major problems occur whenever there is a heavy reliance upon memory, unsupported by routines or systematic reminders. This SOP addresses the complete task of transferring position responsibility and the associated relief briefing.Position relief unavoidably provides workload for specialists at the time of relief. The intent of this SOP is to make the transfer of position responsibility take place smoothly and to ensure a complete transfer of information with a minimum amount of workload. The method takes advantage of a self-briefing concept in which the relieving specialist obtains needed status information by reading from the Status Information Area/s to begin the relief process. Up to the moment information related to the control of aircraft or vehicular movements requires verbal exchanges between specialists during the relief process. The method also specifies the moment when the transfer of position responsibility occurs.In the final part of the relief process, the specialist being relieved monitors and reviews the position to ensure that nothing has been overlooked or incorrectly displayed and that the transfer of position responsibility occurred with a complete briefing.TERMSThe following terms are important for a complete understanding of this SOP:\nStatus Information Area (SIA). Manual or automatic displays of the current status of position related equipment and operational conditions or procedures.Written Notes. Manually recorded items of information kept at designated locations on the position of operation. They may be an element of the Status Information Area/s.Checklist. An ordered listing of items to be covered during a position relief.PRECAUTIONSSpecialists involved in the position relief process should not rush or be influenced to rush.During position operation, each item of status information which is or may be an operational factor for the relieving specialist should be recorded as soon as it is operationally feasible so that it will not be forgotten or incorrectly recorded.Extra care should be taken when more than one specialist relieves or is being relieved from a position at the same time; e.g., combining or decombining positions. Such simultaneous reliefs should be approached with caution.RESPONSIBILITIESThe specialist being relieved must be responsible for ensuring that any pertinent status information of which he/she is aware is relayed to the relieving specialist and is either:Accurately displayed in the Status Information Area/s for which he/she has responsibility, orRelayed to the position having responsibility for accurately displaying the status information.The relieving specialist must be responsible for ensuring that, prior to accepting responsibility for the position, any unresolved questions pertaining to the operation of the position are resolved.The relieving specialist and the specialist being relieved must share equal responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the position relief briefing.The specialists engaged in a position relief must conduct the relief process at the position being relieved unless other procedures have been established and authorized by the facility air traffic manager.NOTE-\nThe “sharing” of this responsibility means that the specialist being relieved is obligated to provide a complete, accurate briefing and the relieving specialist is obligated to ensure that a briefing takes place and is to his/her total satisfaction.\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCESSPREVIEW THE POSITION\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Follow checklist and review the Status Information Area(s).\nNOTE-\nThis sub‐step may be replaced by an authorized pre-position briefing provided an equivalent review of checklist items is accomplished.\n2. Observe position equipment, operational situation, and the work environment.\n3. Listen to voice communications and observe other operational actions.\n4. Observe current and pending aircraft and vehicular traffic and correlate with flight and other movement information.\n5. Indicate to the specialist being relieved that the position has been previewed and that the verbal briefing may begin.\nNOTE-\nSubsteps 6a2, 3, and 4 may be conducted concurrently or in any order.\nVERBAL BRIEFING\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Brief the relieving specialist on the abnormal status of items not listed on the Status Information Area(s) as well as on any items of special interest calling for verbal explanation or additional discussion.\n2. Brief on reported weather and other weather related information.\n3. Brief on traffic if applicable.\n4. Brief communication status of all known aircraft except for ERAM facilities using Voice Communication Indicator (VCI).\n5. Ask questions necessary to ensure a complete understanding of the operational situation.\n6. Completely answer any questions asked.\nASSUMPTION OF POSITION RESPONSIBILITY\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Make a statement or otherwise indicate to the specialist being relieved that position responsibility has been assumed.\n2. Release the position to the relieving specialist and mentally note the time.\nREVIEW THE POSITION\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Check, verify, and update the information obtained in steps 6a and b.\n2. Check position equipment in accordance with existing directives.\n3. Review checklist, Status Information Area/s, written notes, and other prescribed sources of information and advise the relieving specialist of known omissions, updates, or inaccuracies.\n4. Observe overall position operation to determine if assistance is needed.\n5. If assistance is needed, provide or summon it as appropriate.\n6. Advise the appropriate position regarding known Status Information Area(s) omissions, updates, or inaccuracies.\n7. Sign‐on the relieving specialist with the time as noted in step 6c2.\n8. Sign off the position in accordance with existing directives or otherwise indicate that the relief process is complete.\nPrevious | Top | Next\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",

Standard Operating Practice (SOP) for Aircraft Deviating for Weather Near Active Special Activity Airspace (SAA)\nThe procedures listed below must be applied and contained in a facility SOP when aircraft deviate into and/or near an active or scheduled SAA:\nPURPOSEThis appendix prescribes the method and step-by-step process for handling aircraft deviations for weather near active Special Activity Airspace (SAA). The procedures are intended to work in parallel to the preventive procedures outlined in FAA Order JO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, subparagraph 18-2-4a9, which must be applied when weather is scheduled to impact an active or scheduled SAA.\nDISCUSSIONIn all operational facilities, the increase in traffic density and the need for the expeditious movement of traffic without compromising safety have emphasized the importance of handling aircraft deviations for weather in the vicinity of active SAA.The methods, and practices used for handling aircraft requesting or initiating deviations off of their filed route due to weather require time critical responses to the request or in response to observed course deviations. Major issues can occur whenever there is a heavy reliance upon reactive control actions when not performed according to this handbook and the procedures outlined in FAA Order JO 7210.3.Course deviations in areas near active SAA's increase the workload for specialists at the time of their request or observation. The intent of this SOP is to make the handling of the requested deviation or to correct the observed course deviation take place smoothly and to ensure a safe operation with a minimum amount of workload.TERMSThe following terms are important for a complete understanding of this SOP:\nStatus Information Area (SIA). Manual or automatic displays of the current status of position related equipment and operational conditions or procedures.Special Activity Airspace (SAA). Airspace with defined dimensions within the National Airspace System wherein limitations may be imposed upon operations for national defense, homeland security, public interest, or public safety. Special activity airspace includes but is not limited to the following: Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), Altitude Reservations (ALTRV), Military Training Routes (MTR), Air Refueling Tracks and Anchors, Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR), Special Security Instructions (SSI), etc. Special Use Airspace (SUA) is a subset of Special Activity Airspace.Deviation. A departure from a current clearance, such as an off course maneuver to avoid weather or turbulence.Using Agency. The using agency is the military unit or other organization whose activity established the requirement for the SAA. The using agency is responsible for ensuring that:The airspace is used only for its designated purpose.Proper scheduling procedures are established and utilized.The controlling agency is kept informed of changes in scheduled activity, to include the completion of activities for the day.A point of contact is made available to enable the controlling agency to verify schedules, and coordinate access for emergencies, weather diversions, etc.An ATC facility may be designated as the using agency for joint-use areas when that facility has been granted priority for use of the airspace in a joint-use letter of procedure or letter of agreement.NOTE-\nNot every SAA has a using agency as defined in FAA Order JO 7400.2.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7400.2, Para 21-1-11, Using Agency.\nPRECAUTIONSUnless clearance of nonparticipating aircraft in/through/adjacent to an active prohibited/restricted/warning area/MOA/ATCAA/stationary ALTRV is provided for in a Letter of Agreement or Letter of Procedure, any clearance issued to a nonparticipating aircraft must ensure separation from these SAAs by the appropriate minima specified in paragraph 9-3-2.The specialist receiving a request for a route deviation in the vicinity of an active SAA cannot issue a clearance into the active SAA airspace, unless the provisions of paragraph 9-3-4 of this handbook are applied. The FAA has no jurisdictional authority over the use of non-joint use prohibited/restricted/warning area airspace; therefore, clearance cannot be issued for flight therein without appropriate approval.If the specialist is able to coordinate approval for entry into the SAA from the using agency, a clearance to the aircraft complying with the provisions coordinated with the using agency can be issued; the specialist must notify the OS/CIC of this situation and of subsequent requests or deviations from other aircraft in the same area.Use of Code 7700 for aircraft deviations into active SAA is not encouraged, particularly in situations involving multiple aircraft. Positive identification of aircraft may be lost if an aircraft deviates from flight plan track, particularly in the event of a momentary loss of radar or other interruption in tracking.RESPONSIBILITY:If a deviation occurs that causes an aircraft to enter an active prohibited/restricted/warning area/MOA/ATCAA/stationary ALTRV, the air traffic team must follow the procedures outlined below:\nAttempt the following:Handoff the aircraft to the Using Agency and transfer communications; orPoint Out the aircraft to the Using Agency.  The controller must:Continue to provide safety alerts and traffic advisories, as appropriate, to the affected aircraft.Continue to coordinate with the Using Agency until the situation is resolved.Assist the aircraft in exiting the SAA.If the handoff or point out is unsuccessful, the controller must:If able, advise the Using Agency of the pilot's actions.Provide safety alerts and traffic advisories, as appropriate.Assist the aircraft in exiting the SAA as quickly as the weather allows.Continue to coordinate with the Using Agency until the situation is resolved.If no approval to enter the SAA is given by the using agency:The specialist must advise the aircraft requesting the course deviation, or deviating toward the SAA, the status of the SAA, and that no clearance can be issued permitting entry into the airspace or;If an alternative course, which remains clear of the active SAA, is available, offer it to the pilot of the aircraft in question.If the pilot of the nonparticipating aircraft exercises their discretion to deviate from that clearance which ensures separation from an active SAA, and the track of the aircraft will not maintain the required minima from an active SAA, controllers must ascertain if the pilot is exercising emergency authority:If so, provide assistance and obtain information as provided in Chapter 10, Emergencies.If not, provide appropriate pilot deviation notification as specified in paragraph 2-1-26, Pilot Deviation Notification.\nPrevious | Top\n7110.65 |\nATPUBS |\nFAA |\nSend your comments regarding this website.",
