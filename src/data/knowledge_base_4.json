This Glossary was compiled to promote a common understanding of the terms used in the Air Traffic Control system. It includes those terms which are intended for pilot/controller communications. Those terms most frequently used in pilot/controller communications are printed in bold italics . The definitions are primarily defined in an operational sense applicable to both users and operators of the National Airspace System. Use of the Glossary will preclude any misunderstandings concerning the system’s design, function, and purpose. b. Because of the international nature of flying, terms used in the Lexicon, published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), are included when they differ from FAA definitions. These terms are followed by “[ICAO].” For the reader’s convenience, there are also cross references to related terms in other parts of the Glossary and to other documents, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). c. This Glossary will be revised, as necessary, to maintain a common understanding of the system. EXPLANATION OF CHANGES d. Terms Added: RUNWAY CONDITION CODES (RWYCC) RUNWAY CONDITION REPORT (RWYCR) SPECIAL AIR TRAFFIC RULES (SATR) SPECIAL FLIGHT RULES AREA (SFRA) WEATHER RECONNAISSANCE AREA (WRA) e. Terms Modified: BRAKING ACTION (GOOD, FAIR, POOR, OR NIL) BRAKING ACTION ADVISORIES ENHANCED FLIGHT VISION SYSTEM (EFVS) ESTABLISHED PRECIPITATION RADAR WEATHER DESCRIPTIONS RADAR IDENTIFICATION f. Editorial/format changes were made where necessary. Revision bars were not used due to the insignificant nature of the changes."

ABBREVIATED IFR FLIGHT PLANS − An authorization by ATC requiring pilots to submit only that information needed for the purpose of ATC. It includes only a small portion of the usual IFR flight plan information. In certain instances, this may be only aircraft identification, location, and pilot request. Other information may be requested if needed by ATC for separation/control purposes. It is frequently used by aircraft which are airborne and desire an instrument approach or by aircraft which are on the ground and desire a climb to VFR-on-top. (See VFR-ON-TOP.) (Refer to AIM.) ABEAM − An aircraft is “abeam” a fix, point, or object when that fix, point, or object is approximately 90 degrees to the right or left of the aircraft track. Abeam indicates a general position rather than a precise point. ABORT − To terminate a preplanned aircraft maneuver; e.g., an aborted takeoff. ACC [ICAO] − (See ICAO term AREA CONTROL CENTER.)

An actual time determined at freeze calculated landing time (FCLT) or meter list display interval (MLDI) for the adapted vertex for each arrival aircraft based upon runway configuration, airport acceptance rate, airport arrival delay period, and other metered arrival aircraft. This time is either the vertex time of arrival (VTA) of the aircraft or the tentative calculated landing time (TCLT)/ACLT of the previous aircraft plus the arrival aircraft interval (AAI), whichever is later. This time will not be updated in response to the aircraft’s progress. ACTUAL NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE (ANP) − (See REQUIRED NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE.) ADDITIONAL SERVICES − Advisory information provided by ATC which includes but is not limited to the following: a. Traffic advisories. b. Vectors, when requested by the pilot, to assist aircraft receiving traffic advisories to avoid observed traffic. c.

Controlled airspace in the United States is designated as follows: 1. CLASS A − Generally, that airspace from 18,000 feet MSL up to and including FL 600, including the airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles of the coast of the 48 contiguous States and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized, all persons must operate their aircraft under IFR. 2. CLASS B − Generally, that airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports in terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually tailored and consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures once an aircraft enters the airspace. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace. The cloud clearance requirement for VFR operations is “clear of clouds.” 3. CLASS C − Generally, that airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and that have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplane- ments. Although the configuration of each Class C area is individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a surface area with a 5 nautical mile (NM) radius, a circle with a 10NM radius that extends no lower than 1,200 feet up to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, and an outer area that is not charted. Each person must establish two-way radio commu- nications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the airspace. VFR aircraft are only separated from IFR aircraft within the airspace. (See OUTER AREA.) 4. CLASS D − Generally, that airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower. The configuration of each Class D airspace area is individually tailored and when instrument procedures are published, the airspace will normally be designed to contain the procedures. Arrival extensions for instrument approach procedures may be Class D or Class E airspace. Unless otherwise authorized, each person must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace."

CRUISE − Used in an ATC clearance to authorize a pilot to conduct flight at any altitude from the minimum IFR altitude up to and including the altitude specified in the clearance. The pilot may level off at any intermediate altitude within this block of airspace. Climb/descent within the block is to be made at the discretion of the pilot. However, once the pilot starts descent and verbally reports leaving an altitude in the block, he/she may not return to that altitude without additional ATC clearance. Further, it is approval for the pilot to proceed to and make an approach at destination airport and can be used in conjunction with: a. An airport clearance limit at locations with a standard/special instrument approach procedure. The CFRs require that if an instrument letdown to an airport is necessary, the pilot shall make the letdown in accordance with a standard/special instrument approach procedure for that airport, or b. An airport clearance limit at locations that are within/below/outside controlled airspace and with- out a standard/special instrument approach procedure. Such a clearance is NOT AUTHORIZA- TION for the pilot to descend under IFR conditions below the applicable minimum IFR altitude nor does it imply that ATC is exercising control over aircraft in Class G airspace; however, it provides a means for the aircraft to proceed to destination airport, descend, and land in accordance with applicable CFRs governing VFR flight operations. Also, this provides search and rescue protection until such time as the IFR flight plan is closed. (See INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE.) CRUISE CLIMB − A climb technique employed by aircraft, usually at a constant power setting, resulting in an increase of altitude as the aircraft weight decreases. CRUISING ALTITUDE − An altitude or flight level maintained during en route level flight. This is a constant altitude and should not be confused with a cruise clearance. (See ALTITUDE.)

This equipment may be used to monitor certain non − radar approaches, but is primarily used to conduct a precision instrument approach (PAR) wherein the controller issues guidance instructions to the pilot based on the aircraft’s position in relation to the final approach course (azimuth), the glidepath (elevation), and the distance (range) from the touchdown point on the runway as displayed on the radar scope. Note: The abbreviation “PAR” is also used to denote preferential arrival routes in ARTCC computers. (See GLIDEPATH.) (See PAR.) (See PREFERENTIAL ROUTES.) (See ICAO term PRECISION APPROACH RADAR.) (Refer to AIM.) PRECISION APPROACH RADAR [ICAO] − Pri- mary radar equipment used to determine the position of an aircraft during final approach, in terms of lateral and vertical deviations relative to a nominal approach path, and in range relative to touchdown.

VCOA procedures are developed to avoid obstacles greater than 3 statute miles from the departure end of the runway as an alternative to complying with climb gradients greater than 200 feet per nautical mile. Pilots are responsible to advise ATC as early as possible of the intent to fly the VCOA option prior to departure. These textual procedures are published in the ‘Take − Off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures’ section of the Terminal Procedures Publications and/or appear as an option on a Graphic ODP. (See AIM.) VISUAL DESCENT POINT − A defined point on the final approach course of a nonprecision straight-in approach procedure from which normal descent from the MDA to the runway touchdown point may be commenced, provided the approach threshold of that runway, or approach lights, or other markings identifiable with the approach end of that runway are clearly visible to the pilot. VISUAL FLIGHT RULES − Rules that govern the procedures for conducting flight under visual conditions. The term “VFR” is also used in the United States to indicate"

There are two ways to effect this separation: a. The tower controller sees the aircraft involved and issues instructions, as necessary, to ensure that the aircraft avoid each other. b. A pilot sees the other aircraft involved and upon instructions from the controller provides his/her own separation by maneuvering his/her aircraft as necessary to avoid it. This may involve following another aircraft or keeping it in sight until it is no longer a factor. (See SEE AND AVOID.) (Refer to 14 CFR Part 91.) VLF − (See VERY LOW FREQUENCY.) VMC − (See VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.) VOICE SWITCHING AND CONTROL SYSTEM − The VSCS is a computer controlled switching system that provides air traffic controllers with all voice circuits (air to ground and ground to ground) necessary for air traffic control. (See VOICE SWITCHING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.) (Refer to AIM.) VOR − A ground-based electronic navigation aid transmitting very high frequency navigation signals, 360 degrees in azimuth, oriented from magnetic north. Used as the basis for navigation in the National Airspace System. The VOR periodically identifies itself by Morse Code and may have an additional voice identification feature. Voice features may be used by ATC or FSS for transmitting instructions/ information to pilots. (See NAVIGATIONAL AID.) (Refer to AIM.) VOR TEST SIGNAL − (See VOT.) VORTAC − A navigation aid providing VOR azimuth, TACAN azimuth, and TACAN distance measuring equipment (DME) at one site. (See DISTANCE MEASURING EQUIPMENT.) (See NAVIGATIONAL AID.) (See TACAN.) (See VOR.) (Refer to AIM.) VORTICES − Circular patterns of air created by the movement of an airfoil through the air when generating lift. As an airfoil moves through the atmosphere in sustained flight, an area of area of low pressure is created above it. The air flowing from the high pressure area to the low pressure area around and about the tips of the airfoil tends to roll up into two rapidly rotating vortices, cylindrical in shape. These vortices are the most predominant parts of aircraft wake turbulence and their rotational force is dependent upon the wing loading, gross weight, and speed of the generating aircraft. The vortices from medium to super aircraft can be of extremely high velocity and hazardous to smaller aircraft. (See AIRCRAFT CLASSES.) (See WAKE TURBULENCE.) (Refer to AIM.) VOT − A ground facility which emits a test signal to check VOR receiver accuracy. Some VOTs are available to the user while airborne, and others are limited to ground use only.

WAKE TURBULENCE − Phenomena resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air. (See AIRCRAFT CLASSES.) (See JET BLAST.) (See VORTICES.) (Refer to AIM.) WARNING AREA − (See SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE.) WAYPOINT − A predetermined geographical posi- tion used for route/instrument approach definition, progress reports, published VFR routes, visual reporting points or points for transitioning and/or circumnavigating controlled and/or special use airspace, that is defined relative to a VORTAC station or in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates. WEATHER ADVISORY − In aviation weather forecast practice, an expression of hazardous weather conditions not predicted in the area forecast, as they affect the operation of air traffic and as prepared by the NWS. (See AIRMET.) (See SIGMET.) WEATHER RECONNAISSANCE AREA (WRA) − A WRS is airspace with defined dimensions and published by Notice to Airmen, which is established to support weather reconnaissance/research flights. Air traffic control services are not provided within WRAs. Only participating weather reconnaissance/ research aircraft from the 53 rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Aircraft Operations Center are permitted to operate within a WRA. A WRA may only be established in airspace within U.S. Flight Information Regions outside of U.S. territorial airspace. WHEN ABLE − a. In conjunction with ATC instructions, gives the pilot the latitude to delay compliance until a condition or event has been reconciled. Unlike “pilot discretion,” when instructions are prefaced “when able,” the pilot is expected to seek the first opportunity to comply. b. In conjunction with a weather deviation clearance, requires the pilot to determine when he/she is clear of weather, then execute ATC instructions. c. Once a maneuver has been initiated, the pilot is expected to continue until the specifications of the instructions have been met. “When able,” should not be used when expeditious compliance is required. WIDE-AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (WAAS) − The WAAS is a satellite navigation system consisting of the equipment and software which augments the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The WAAS provides enhanced integrity, accuracy, availability, and continuity over and above GPS SPS. The differential correction function provides improved accuracy required for precision approach. WIDE AREA MULTILATERATION (WAM)– A distributed surveillance technology which may utilize any combination of signals from Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) (Modes A and C) and Mode S transponders, and ADS-B transmissions. Multiple geographically dispersed ground sensors measure the time-of-arrival of the transponder messages. Aircraft position is deter- mined by joint processing of the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements computed between a reference and the ground stations’ measured time-of-arrival.
