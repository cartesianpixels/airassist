      "text": "2/20/25 JO 7110.65BB Explanation of Changes Basic Direct questions through appropriate facility/service center office staff to the Office of Primary Interest (OPI) a. 2 − 6 − 4. ISSUING WEATHER AND CHAFF AREAS This change incorporates guidance in the use of satellite derived weather from the Offshore Precipitation Capability (OPC) into FAA JO Order 7110.65, Air Traffic Control. b. 2 − 10 − 1. EN ROUTE OR OCEANIC SECTOR TEAM POSITION RESPONSIBILITIES 5 − 13 − 10. ERAM VISUAL INDICATOR OF SPECIAL ACTIVITY AIRSPACE (SAA) STATUS Appendix B. Standard Operating Practice (SOP) for Aircraft Deviating for Weather Near Active Special Activity Airspace (SAA) This change adds the words “Airspace Status View/SAA Filter View” to paragraph 2 − 10 − 1. It also replaces “all SAAs” with “adapted Special Activity Airspace (SAA)” in paragraphs 2 − 10 − 1 and 5 − 13 − 10 since facilities cannot ensure the situation display reflects the status of all SAA, but only those adapted within their Automated Problem Detection (APD) Area. This change also revises the Special Activity Airspace (SAA) definition in Appendix B, paragraph 3, TERMS, to align with the current Pilot/Controller Glossary (P/CG) definition. It also adds a Note stating, “Not every SAA has a using agency” for purposes of clarity and understanding. This change replaces SAA in Appendix B, paragraph 4, PRECAUTIONS, with prohibited/restricted/warning area/MOA/ATCAA/stationary ALTRV, to align with paragraph 9 − 3 − 2. This change replaces SAA in Appendix B, paragraph 5, RESPONSIBILITY, with prohibited/restricted/warning area/MOA/ATCAA/stationary ALTRV, to align with paragraph 9 − 3 − 2. c. 5 − 4 − 10. EN ROUTE FOURTH LINE DATA BLOCK USAGE This change allows facilities to expand the use of the fourth line of an en route data block to include alphanumeric characters that are specified in a letter of agreement (LOA) or facility directive. d. Editorial Changes Editorial changes include the incorporation of new language into paragraph 9 − 1 − 2 that indicates when flight inspections are in progress, expands a NOTE to describe a recorded run, and removes the outdated language “in terminal areas” since flight checks are not limited to terminal airspace; a reference correction in subparagraph 2 − 6 − 4h1; a change to remove the outdated interpretation hyperlink reference in paragraph 5 − 9 − 5 and paragraph 6 − 7 − 2, which also refers to the outdated paragraph 5 − 9 − 5 interpretation; and the addition of a hyperlink reference to an interpretation of paragraph 4 − 7 − 12; a universal editorial change for plain language to replace “shall” with “must” where appropriate; and a universal editorial lower casing “part” and “section” in CFR references e. Entire publication Additional editorial/format changes were made where necessary. Revision bars were not used because of the insignificant nature of these changes. Explanation of Changes E of C − 1"

SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (SMS) Safety is fundamental to the provision of air traffic management and communication, navigation, and surveillance services. The ATO develops, implements, and maintains processes, tools, and guiding principles within the framework of a Safety Management System (SMS) to ensure that performance-based NAS safety goals are achieved. The ATO SMS gives the responsibility for owning and executing the SMS to all employees at all levels of the ATO. All ATO employees must strive not only to maintain safety in the NAS for those services they provide but also to continuously improve the ATO SMS. Direction regarding the ATO SMS and its application is found in FAA Order JO 1000.37, Air Traffic Organization Safety Management System . Additional information pertaining to ATO SMS requirements and processes can be obtained by visiting the SMS Toolbox , emailing the Office of Safety and Technical Training (AJI) at 9-AJI-SMS@faa.gov , or contacting the service center Quality Control Group. SMS training is available for all employees via eLMS. Additional courses along with Technical Training for SMS Practitioners and SMS Facilitators are available from AJI. 1 − 1 − 13. REFERENCES TO FAA NON-AIR TRAFFIC ORGANIZATIONS When references are made to regional office organizations that are not part of the Air Traffic Organization (Communications Center, Flight Standards, Airport offices, etc.), the facility should contact the FAA region where the facility is physically located—not the region where the facility’s service area office is located. 1 − 1 − 14. DISTRIBUTION a. This order is distributed to selected offices in Washington headquarters, regional offices, service area offices, the William J. Hughes Technical Center, the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, and to all air traffic field facilities and international aviation field offices. b. This order is distributed electronically to all who subscribe to receive email notifications through the FAA’s website. All organizations are responsible for viewing, downloading, and subscribing to receive email notifications when changes occur to this order.

The primary purpose of the ATC system is to prevent a collision involving aircraft operating in the system. b. In addition to its primary purpose, the ATC system also: 1. Provides a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic. 2. Supports National Security and Homeland Defense missions. c. The ATC system must provide certain additional services to the extent permitted. The provision of additional services is not optional on the part of the controller, but rather required when the work situation permits. It is recognized that the provision of these services may be precluded by various factors, including, but not limited to: 1. Volume of traffic. 2. Frequency congestion. 3. Quality of surveillance. 4. Controller workload. 5. Higher priority duties. 6. The physical inability to scan and detect situations falling in this category. d. Controllers must provide air traffic control service in accordance with the procedures and minima in this order, except when one or more of the following conditions exists: 1. A deviation is necessary to conform with ICAO Documents, National Rules of the Air, or special agreements where the U.S. provides air traffic control service in airspace outside the U.S. and its possessions or: NOTE − Pilots are required to abide by CFRs or other applicable regulations regardless of the application of any procedure or minima in this order. 2.

REFERENCE − P/CG Term − Model Aircraft. 2 − 1 − 2. DUTY PRIORITY a. Give first priority to separating aircraft and issuing safety alerts as required in this order. Good judgment must be used in prioritizing all other provisions of this order based on the requirements of the situation at hand. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2 − 1 − 6 , Safety Alert. NOTE − Because there are many variables involved, it is virtually impossible to develop a standard list of duty priorities that would apply uniformly to every conceivable situation. Each set of circumstances must be evaluated on its own merit, and when more than one action is required, controllers must exercise their best judgment based on the facts and circumstances known to them. That action which is most critical from a safety standpoint is performed first. b. Provide support to national security and homeland defense activities to include, but not be limited to, reporting of suspicious and/or unusual aircraft/pilot activities. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations. c. Provide and/or solicit weather information in accordance with procedures and requirements outlined in this order. NOTE − Controllers are responsible to become familiar with and stay aware of current weather information needed to perform ATC duties. d. Provide additional services to the extent possible, contingent only upon higher priority duties and other factors including limitations of radar, volume of traffic, frequency congestion, and workload. 2 − 1 − 3. PROCEDURAL PREFERENCE a. Use automation procedures in preference to nonautomation procedures when workload, communications, and equipment capabilities permit. b. Use automation procedures that provide closed loop clearances in preference to open loop clearances to promote operational advantage for time − based management (TBM) when workload permits. (e.g., a QU route pick that anticipates length of vector and includes the next fix that ties into the route of flight.) c. Use radar separation in preference to nonradar separation when it will be to an operational advantage and workload, communications, and equipment permit. d. Use nonradar separation in preference to radar separation when the situation dictates that an operational advantage will be gained. NOTE − One situation may be where vertical separation would preclude excessive vectoring. 2 − 1 − 4. OPERATIONAL PRIORITY It is recognized that traffic flow may affect the controller’s ability to provide priority handling. However, without compromising safety, good judgment must be used in each situation to facilitate the most expeditious movement of priority aircraft.

However, a pilot’s retention of an IFR flight plan does not afford priority over VFR aircraft. For example, this does not preclude the requirement for the pilot of an arriving IFR aircraft to adjust his/her flight path, as necessary, to enter a traffic pattern in sequence with arriving VFR aircraft. a. An aircraft in distress has the right of way over all other air traffic. REFERENCE − 14 CFR Section 91.113(c). b. Treat air ambulance flights as follows: 1. Provide priority handling to civil air ambulance flights when the pilot, in radio transmissions, verbally identifies the flight by stating “MEDEVAC” followed by the FAA authorized call sign or the full civil registration letters/numbers. Good judgment must be used in each situation to facilitate the most expeditious movement of a MEDEVAC aircraft. NOTE − If a flight plan includes the letter “L” for “MEDEVAC” and/or includes “MEDEVAC” in Item 11 (Remarks) of the flight plan or Item 18 (Other Information) of an international flight plan, the entries are considered informational in nature only and not an identification for operational priority. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2 − 4 − 20 , Aircraft Identification. 2. Provide priority handling to AIR EVAC and HOSP flights when verbally requested by the pilot. NOTE − If a flight plan includes “HOSP” or “AIR EVAC” in either Item 11 (Remarks) or Item 18 (Other Information) of an international flight plan, the entries are considered informational in nature only and not an identification for operational priority. For aircraft identification in radio transmissions, civilian pilots will use normal call signs when filing “HOSP” and military pilots will use the “EVAC” call sign. 3. Assist the pilots of MEDEVAC, AIR EVAC, and HOSP aircraft to avoid areas of significant weather and adverse conditions. 4. If requested by a pilot, provide additional assistance (i.e., landline notifications) to expedite ground handling of patients, vital organs, or urgently needed medical materials. c. Provide priority handling and expedite the movement of presidential aircraft and entourage and any rescue support aircraft as well as related control messages when traffic conditions and communications facilities permit.

In either case, if time permits, include the reason for this action. 2 − 1 − 6. SAFETY ALERT Issue a safety alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is in a position/altitude that, in your judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft. Once the pilot informs you action is being taken to resolve the situation, you may discontinue the issuance of further alerts. Do not assume that because someone else has responsibility for the aircraft that the unsafe situation has been observed and the safety alert issued; inform the appropriate controller. NOTE − 1. The issuance of a safety alert is a first priority (see paragraph 2 − 1 − 2 , Duty Priority) once the controller observes and recognizes a situation of unsafe aircraft proximity to terrain, obstacles, or other aircraft. Conditions, such as workload, traffic volume, the quality/limitations of the radar system, and the available lead time to react are factors in determining whether it is reasonable for the controller to observe and recognize such situations. While a controller cannot see immediately the development of every situation where a safety alert must be issued, the controller must remain vigilant for such situations and issue a safety alert when the situation is recognized. 2. Recognition of situations of unsafe proximity may result from MSAW/E − MSAW, automatic altitude readouts, Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert, observations on a PAR scope, or pilot reports. 3. Once the alert is issued, it is solely the pilot’s prerogative to determine what course of action, if any, will be taken. a. Terrain/Obstruction Alert. Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is at an altitude that, in your judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain and/or obstructions. Issue the alert as follows: PHRASEOLOGY − LOW ALTITUDE ALERT (call sign), CHECK YOUR ALTITUDE IMMEDIATELY. and, if the aircraft is not yet on final approach, THE (as appropriate) MEA/MVA/MOCA/MIA IN YOUR AREA IS (altitude). REFERENCE − P/CG Term − Final Approach − IFR b. Aircraft Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert. Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware of another aircraft at an altitude that you believe places them in unsafe proximity. If feasible, offer the pilot an alternate course of action. When an alternate course of action is given, end the transmission with the word “immediately.” PHRASEOLOGY − TRAFFIC ALERT (call sign) (position of aircraft) ADVISE YOU TURN LEFT/RIGHT (heading), and/or CLIMB/DESCEND (specific altitude if appropriate) IMMEDIATELY. EXAMPLE − “Traffic Alert, Cessna Three Four Juliett, 12’o clock, 1 mile advise you turn left immediately.” or “Traffic Alert, Cessna Three-Four Juliett, 12’o clock, 1 mile advise you"

NOTE − Inflight equipment malfunctions include partial or complete failure of equipment, which may affect either safety, separation standards, and/or the ability of the flight to proceed under IFR, or in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace, in the ATC system. Controllers may expect reports from pilots regarding VOR, TACAN, ADF, GPS, RVSM capability, or low frequency navigation receivers, impairment of air − ground communications capability, or other equipment deemed appropriate by the pilot (e.g., airborne weather radar). Pilots should communicate the nature and extent of any assistance desired from ATC. b. Provide the maximum assistance possible consistent with equipment, workload, and any special handling requested. c. Relay to other controllers or facilities who will subsequently handle the aircraft, all pertinent details concerning the aircraft and any special handling required or being provided. 2 − 1 − 8. MINIMUM FUEL If an aircraft declares a state of “minimum fuel,” inform any facility to whom control jurisdiction is transferred of the minimum fuel problem and be alert for any occurrence which might delay the aircraft en route. NOTE − Use of the term “minimum fuel” indicates recognition by a pilot that his/her fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching destination, he/she cannot accept any undue delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely an advisory that indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur. A minimum fuel advisory does not imply a need for traffic priority. Common sense and good judgment will determine the extent of assistance to be given in minimum fuel situations. If, at any time, the remaining usable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing, the pilot should declare an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes. 2 − 1 − 9. REPORTING ESSENTIAL FLIGHT INFORMATION Report as soon as possible to the appropriate FSS, airport manager’s office, ARTCC, approach control facility, operations office, or military operations office any information concerning components of the NAS or any flight conditions which may have an adverse effect on air safety. NOTE − FSSs are responsible for classifying and disseminating Notices to Air Missions. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3 − 3 − 3 , Timely Information.

MARSA may only be applied to military operations specified in a letter of agreement or other appropriate FAA or military document. NOTE − Application of MARSA is a military command prerogative. It will not be invoked indiscriminately by individual units or pilots. It will be used only for IFR operations requiring its use. Commands authorizing MARSA will ensure that its implementation and terms of use are documented and coordinated with the control agency having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations are conducted. Terms of use will assign responsibility and provide for separation among participating aircraft. b. ATC facilities do not invoke or deny MARSA. Their sole responsibility concerning the use of MARSA is to provide separation between military aircraft engaged in MARSA operations and other nonparticipating IFR aircraft. c. DoD must ensure that military pilots requesting special use airspace/ATCAAs have coordinated with the scheduling agency, have obtained approval for entry, and are familiar with the appropriate MARSA procedures. ATC is not responsible for determining which military aircraft are authorized to enter special use airspace/ATCAAs. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9 − 2"

MILITARY PROCEDURES Military procedures in the form of additions, modifications, and exceptions to the basic FAA procedure are prescribed herein when a common procedure has not been attained or to fulfill a specific requirement. They must be applied by: a. ATC facilities operated by that military service. EXAMPLE − 1. An Air Force facility providing service for an Air Force base would apply USAF procedures to all traffic regardless of class. 2. A Navy facility providing service for a Naval Air Station would apply USN procedures to all traffic regardless of class. b. ATC facilities, regardless of their parent organization (FAA, USAF, USN, USA), supporting a designated military airport exclusively. This designation determines which military procedures are to be applied. EXAMPLE − 1. An FAA facility supports a USAF base exclusively; USAF procedures are applied to all traffic at that base. 2. An FAA facility provides approach control service for a Naval Air Station as well as supporting a civil airport; basic FAA procedures are applied at both locations by the FAA facility. 3. A USAF facility supports a USAF base and provides approach control service to a satellite civilian airport; USAF procedures are applied at both locations by the USAF facility.

REFERENCE − P/CG Term − Formation Flight. c. After join − up, aircraft beacon code assignment will be determined by formation type. 1. For a standard formation only the aircraft acting as the lead will squawk an ATC assigned beacon code. Ensure all other aircraft squawk standby. 2. For a nonstandard formation, each aircraft should squawk an ATC assigned beacon code. Controller discretion allows aircraft in a nonstandard formation to squawk standby if operationally advantageous.

Do not use this suffix, however, in ground-to-air communication. NOTE − USAF solo students who have passed an instrument certification check may penetrate cloud layers in climb or descent only. Requests for revised clearances to avoid clouds in level flight can still be expected. This does not change the requirement to use the letter “Z” as a suffix to the aircraft identification.

A single frequency may be used for more than one function except as follows: TERMINAL. When combining positions in the tower, do not use ground control frequency for airborne communications. NOTE − Due to the limited number of frequencies assigned to towers for the ground control function, it is very likely that airborne use of a ground control frequency could cause interference to other towers or interference to your aircraft from another tower. When combining these functions, it is recommended combining them on local control. The ATIS may be used to specify the desired frequency. 2 − 4 − 2. MONITORING Monitor interphones and assigned radio frequencies continuously. NOTE − Although all FAA facilities, including RAPCONs and RATCFs, are required to monitor all assigned frequencies continuously, USAF facilities may not monitor all unpublished discrete frequencies. 2 − 4 − 3. PILOT ACKNOWLEDGMENT/READ BACK Ensure pilots acknowledge all Air Traffic Clearances and ATC Instructions. When a pilot reads back an Air Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction: a. Ensure that items read back are correct. b. Ensure the read back of hold short instructions, whether a part of taxi instructions or a LAHSO clearance. c. Ensure pilots use call signs and/or registration numbers in any read back acknowledging an Air Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction. NOTE − 1. ATC Clearance/Instruction Read Back guidance for pilots in the AIM states: a . Although pilots should read back the “numbers,” unless otherwise required by procedure or controller request, pilots may acknowledge clearances, control instructions, or other information by using “Wilco,” “Roger,” “Affirmative,” or other words or remarks with their aircraft identification. b. Altitudes contained in charted procedures, such as departure procedures, instrument approaches, etc., need not be read back unless they are specifically stated by the controller. c. Initial read back of a taxi, departure or landing clearance should include the runway assignment, including left, right, center, etc. if applicable. 2. Until a pilot acknowledges a controller’s clearance or instruction, a controller cannot know if a pilot will comply with the clearance or remain as previously cleared.

FAMILIARIZATION Controllers must become familiar with pertinent weather information when coming on duty, and stay aware of current and forecasted weather information needed to perform ATC duties. NOTE − Every phase of flight has the potential to be impacted by weather, and emphasis must be placed on gathering, reporting and disseminating weather information. 2 − 6 − 2. PIREP SOLICITATION AND DISSEMINATION Emphasis must be placed on the solicitation and dissemination of Urgent (UUA) and Routine (UA) PIREPs. Timely dissemination of PIREPs alerts pilots to weather conditions and provides information useful to forecasters in the development of aviation forecasts. PIREPs also provide information required by ATC in the provision of safe and efficient use of airspace. This includes reports of strong frontal activity, squall lines, thunderstorms, light to severe icing, wind shear and turbulence (including clear air turbulence) of moderate or greater intensity, braking action, volcanic eruptions and volcanic ash clouds, detection of sulfur gases in the cabin, and other conditions pertinent to flight safety. Controllers must provide the information in sufficient detail to assist pilots in making decisions pertinent to flight safety. NOTE − Routine PIREPs indicating a lack of forecasted weather conditions, for example, a lack of icing or turbulence, are also valuable to aviation weather forecasters and pilots. This is especially true when adverse conditions are expected or forecasted but do not develop or no longer exist.

In addition to the altimeter setting provided on initial contact, issue changes in altimeter setting to aircraft executing a nonprecision instrument approach as frequently as practical when the official weather report includes the remarks “pressure falling rapidly.” d. If the altimeter setting must be obtained by the pilot of an arriving aircraft from another source, instruct the pilot to obtain the altimeter setting from that source. NOTE − 1. The destination altimeter setting, whether from a local or remote source, is the setting upon which the instrument approach is predicated. 2. Approach charts for many locations specify the source of altimeter settings as non-FAA facilities, such as UNICOMs. e. When issuing clearance to descend below the lowest usable flight level, advise the pilot of the altimeter setting of the weather reporting station nearest the point the aircraft will descend below that flight level. Local directives may delegate this responsibility to an alternate sector when Optimized Profile Descents (OPD) commence in sectors consisting entirely of Class A airspace. f. Department of Defense (DoD) aircraft that are authorized to operate in restricted areas, MOAs, and ATC assigned airspace areas on “single altimeter settings” (CFR Exemption 2861A), must be issued altimeter settings in accordance with standard procedures while the aircraft are en route to and from the restricted areas, MOAs, and ATC assigned airspace areas. NOTE − The DoD is responsible for conducting all “single altimeter setting” operations within the boundaries of MOAs, restricted areas, and ATCAAs. Under an LOA, the DoD provides safe altitude clearance between DoD aircraft and other aircraft operating within, above, and below the MOAs, restricted areas, and ATCAAs with appropriate clearance of terrain.

With an actual altimeter of 31.28 inches Hg, the Mode C equipped aircraft will show 3,300 feet when assigned 3,000 feet. This will occur unless local directives authorize entering the altimeter setting 31.00 into the computer system regardless of the actual barometric pressure. 2. Flight Standards will implement high barometric pressure procedures by NOTAM defining the geographic area affected. 3.

Identify each ATIS message by a phonetic letter code word at both the beginning and the end of the message. Automated systems will have the phonetic letter code automatically appended. Exceptions may be made where omissions are required because of special programs or equipment. 1. Each alphabet letter phonetic word must be used sequentially, except as authorized in subparagraph a 2 , beginning with “Alpha,” ending with “Zulu,” and repeated without regard to the beginning of a new day. Identify the first resumed broadcast message with “Alpha” or the first assigned alphabet letter word in the event of a broadcast interruption of more than 12 hours. 2.

OPERATING PROCEDURES Maintain an ATIS message that reflects the most current arrival and departure information. a. Make a new recording when any of the following occur: 1. Upon receipt of any new official weather regardless of whether there is or is not a change in values. 2. When runway braking action reports are received that indicate runway braking is worse than that which is included in the current ATIS broadcast. 3. When there is a change in any other pertinent data, such as runway change, instrument approach in use, new or canceled NOTAMs/PIREPs update, etc. b. When a pilot acknowledges that he/she has received the ATIS broadcast, controllers may omit those items contained in the broadcasts if they are current. Rapidly changing conditions will be issued by ATC, and the ATIS will contain the following: EXAMPLE − “Latest ceiling/visibility/altimeter/wind/(other conditions) will be issued by approach control/tower.” c. Controllers must ensure that pilots receive the most current pertinent information by taking the following actions, as applicable: 1. When a pilot does not state the appropriate ATIS code on initial contact, ask the pilot to confirm receipt of the current ATIS information.

PROVIDE SERVICE Provide airport traffic control service based only upon observed or known traffic and airport conditions. NOTE − When operating in accordance with CFRs, it is the responsibility of the pilot to avoid collision with other aircraft. However, due to the limited space around terminal locations, traffic information can aid pilots in avoiding collision between aircraft operating within Class B, Class C, or Class D surface areas and the terminal radar service areas, and transiting aircraft operating in proximity to terminal locations. 3 − 1 − 2. PREVENTIVE CONTROL Provide preventive control service only to aircraft operating in accordance with a letter of agreement. When providing this service, issue advice or instructions only if a situation develops which requires corrective action. NOTE − 1. Preventive control differs from other airport traffic control in that repetitious, routine approval of pilot action is eliminated. Controllers intervene only when they observe a traffic conflict developing. 2. Airfield Operating instructions, Memorandums of Understanding, or other specific directives used exclusively by the Department of Defense (DoD) satisfies the criteria in paragraph 3 − 1 − 2 above. 3 − 1 − 3.

At locations equipped with LLWAS, the local controller must provide wind information as follows: NOTE − The LLWAS is designed to detect low level wind shear conditions around the periphery of an airport. It does not detect wind shear beyond that limitation. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10 − 3 − 3, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Detection Systems. (a) If an alert is received, issue the airport wind and the displayed field boundary wind. PHRASEOLOGY − WIND SHEAR ALERT. AIRPORT WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (Location of sensor) BOUNDARY WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (b) If multiple alerts are received, issue an advisory that there are wind shear alerts in two/several/all quadrants. After issuing the advisory, issue the airport wind in accordance with paragraph 3 − 9 − 1 , Departure Information, followed by the field boundary wind most appropriate to the aircraft operation. PHRASEOLOGY − WIND SHEAR ALERTS TWO/SEVERAL/ALL QUADRANTS. AIRPORT WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (Location of sensor) BOUNDARY WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (c) If requested by the pilot, issue specific field boundary wind information even though the LLWAS may not be in alert status. NOTE − The requirements for issuance of wind information remain valid as appropriate under this paragraph, paragraph 3 − 9 − 1 , Departure Information, and paragraph 3 − 10 − 1 , Landing Information. 2. Wind shear detection systems, including TDWR, WSP, LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS − RS provide the capability of displaying microburst alerts, wind shear alerts, and wind information oriented to the threshold or departure end of a runway. When detected, the associated ribbon display allows the controller to read the displayed alert without any need for interpretation. (a) If a wind shear or microburst alert is received for the runway in use, issue the alert information for that runway to arriving and departing aircraft as it is displayed on the ribbon display. PHRASEOLOGY − (Runway) (arrival/departure) WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ALERT, (windspeed) KNOT GAIN/LOSS, (location).

A wind shear alert message will be displayed, followed by an asterisk, advising of a possible wind shear outside of the system network. NOTE − LLWAS NE++ when associated with TDWR can detect wind shear/microbursts outside the network if the TDWR fails. PHRASEOLOGY − (Appropriate wind or alert information) POSSIBLE WIND SHEAR OUTSIDE THE NETWORK. (d) If unstable conditions produce multiple alerts, issue an advisory of multiple wind shear/microburst alerts followed by specific alert or wind information most appropriate to the aircraft operation. PHRASEOLOGY − MULTIPLE WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ALERTS (specific alert or wind information). (e) The LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS − RS are designed to operate with as many as 50 percent of the total sensors inoperative. When all three remote sensors designated for a specific runway arrival or departure wind display line are inoperative then the LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS − RS for that runway arrival/departure must be considered out of service. When a specific runway arrival or departure wind display line is inoperative and wind shear/microburst activity is likely; (for example, frontal activity, convective storms, PIREPs), the following statement must be included on the ATIS, “WIND SHEAR AND MICROBURST INFORMATION FOR RUNWAY (runway number) ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE NOT AVAILABLE.” NOTE − The geographic situation display (GSD) is a supervisory planning tool and is not intended to be a primary tool for microburst or wind shear. d. Wind Shear Escape Procedures. 1. If an aircraft under your control informs you that it is performing a wind shear escape, do not issue control instructions that are contrary to pilot actions. ATC should continue to provide safety alerts regarding terrain or obstacles and traffic advisories for the escape aircraft, as appropriate. EXAMPLE − “Denver Tower, United 1154, wind shear escape.” NOTE − Aircraft that execute a wind shear escape maneuver will usually conduct a full power climb straight ahead and will not accept any control instructions until onboard systems advise the crew or the pilot in command (PIC) advises ATC that the escape maneuver is no longer required. REFERENCE − P/CG Term – Wind Shear Escape. 2. Unless advised by additional aircraft that they are also performing an escape procedure, do not presume that other aircraft in the proximity of the escape aircraft are responding to wind shear alerts/events as well. Continue to provide control instructions, safety alerts, and traffic advisories, as appropriate. 3. Once the responding aircraft has initiated a wind shear escape maneuver, the controller is not responsible for providing approved separation between the aircraft that is responding to an escape and any other aircraft, airspace, terrain, or obstacle. Responsibility for approved separation resumes when one of the following conditions is met: (a) Departures: (1) A crew member informs ATC that the wind shear escape maneuver is complete and ATC observes that approved separation has been"

NOTE − It is important that the pilot be aware of the fact that the directions or headings being provided are suggestions or are advisory in nature. This is to keep the pilot from being inadvertently misled into assuming that radar vectors (and other associated radar services) are being provided when, in fact, they are not. 4.

They are not intended to provide radar benefits to pilots except for those accrued through a more efficient and effective local control position. In addition, local controllers at nonapproach control towers must devote the majority of their time to visually scanning the runways and local area; an assurance of continued positive radar identification could place distracting and operationally inefficient requirements upon the local controller. Therefore, since the requirements of paragraph 5 − 3 − 1 , Application, cannot be assured, the radar functions prescribed above are not considered to be radar services and pilots should not be advised of being in “radar contact.” c. Additional functions may be performed provided the procedures have been reviewed and authorized by appropriate management levels. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5 − 5 − 4 , Minima. d.

REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 1, Aircraft Arresting System, Single Frequency Approach (SFA), Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations, Celestial Navigation (CELNAV) Training. b. Raise aircraft arresting systems whenever: 1. Requested by a pilot. NOTE − The standard emergency phraseology for a pilot requesting an arresting system to be raised for immediate engagement is: “BARRIER − BARRIER − BARRIER” or “CABLE − CABLE − CABLE.” 2. Requested by military authority; e.g., airfield manager, supervisor of flying, mobile control officer, etc. NOTE − USAF. Arresting Systems at the departure end of the runway may remain in the up position when requested by the senior operational commander. The IFR Enroute Supplement and AP-1 will describe specific barrier configuration. ATC will advise transient aircraft of the barrier configuration using the phraseology in subparagraph c, below. 3. A military jet aircraft is landing with known or suspected radio failure or conditions (drag chute/hydraulic/electrical failure, etc.) that indicate an arresting system may be needed. Exceptions are authorized for military aircraft which cannot engage an arresting system (C − 9, C − 141, C − 5, T − 39, etc.) and should be identified in a letter of agreement and/or appropriate military directive. c. When requested by military authority due to freezing weather conditions or malfunction of the activating mechanism, the barrier/cable may remain in a raised position provided aircraft are advised.

To meet the demand for more facilities capable of operating under CAT III weather, Type II equipment is being upgraded to Integrity Level 3. This integrity level will support operations which place a high degree of reliance on ILS guidance for positioning through touchdown. b. Installation of the FFM remote status indicating units is necessary to attain the integrity necessary to meet internationally agreed upon reliability values in support of CAT III operations on Type II ILS equipment. The remote status indicating unit used in conjunction with Type II equipment adds a third integrity test; thereby, producing an approach aid which has integrity capable of providing Level 3 service. c. The remote status sensing unit, when installed in the tower cab, will give immediate indications of localizer out-of-tolerance conditions. The alarm in the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates an inoperative or an out-of-tolerance localizer signal; e.g., the course may have shifted due to equipment malfunction or vehicle/aircraft encroachment into the critical area. d. Operation of the FFM remote sensing unit will be based on the prevailing weather. The FFM remote sensing unit must be operational when the weather is below CAT II ILS minimums. REFERENCE − FAA Order 6750.24, Appendix A, Abnormal Checklist e. When the remote status unit indicates that the localizer FFM is in alarm (aural warning following the preset delay) and: 1. The aircraft is outside the middle marker (MM) or in the absence of a MM, ½ mile final, check for encroachment of those portions of the critical area that can be seen from the tower. It is understood that the entire critical area may not be visible due to low ceilings and poor visibility. The check is strictly to determine possible causal factors for the out-of-tolerance situation. If the alarm has not cleared prior to the aircraft’s arriving at the MM or in the absence of a MM, ½ mile final, immediately issue an advisory that the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates the localizer is unreliable. 2. The aircraft is between the MM or ½ mile final and the inner marker (IM), or if the IM is not installed, the CAT II Missed Approach Point (MAP), immediately issue an advisory that the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates the localizer is unreliable. PHRASEOLOGY − CAUTION, MONITOR INDICATES RUNWAY (number) LOCALIZER UNRELIABLE. 3. The aircraft has passed the IM or the CAT II MAP (if the IM is not installed) there is no action requirement. Although the FFM has been modified with filters which dampen the effect of false alarms, you may expect alarms when aircraft are located between the FFM and the localizer antenna either on landing or on takeoff.

When necessary for a wheeled helicopter to taxi on the surface, use the phraseology in paragraph 3 − 7 − 2 , Taxi and Ground Movement Operations. NOTE − Ground taxiing uses less fuel than hover-taxiing and minimizes air turbulence. However, under certain conditions, such as rough, soft, or uneven terrain, it may become necessary to hover/air-taxi for safety considerations. Helicopters with articulating rotors (usually designs with three or more main rotor blades) are subject to “ground resonance” and may, on rare occasions, suddenly lift off the ground to avoid severe damage or destruction. b. When requested or necessary for a helicopter/VTOL aircraft to proceed at a slow speed above the surface, normally below 20 knots and in ground effect, use the following phraseology, supplemented as appropriate with the phraseology in paragraph 3 − 7 − 2 , Taxi and Ground Movement Operations. PHRASEOLOGY − HOVER-TAXI (supplemented, as appropriate, from paragraph 3 − 7 − 2 , Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.) CAUTION (dust, blowing snow, loose debris, taxiing light aircraft, personnel, etc.).

REFERENCE − P/CG Term − Hover Taxi. AIM, Para 4 − 3 − 17, VFR Helicopter Operations at Controlled Airports. c. When requested or necessary for a helicopter to proceed expeditiously from one point to another, normally below 100 feet AGL and at airspeeds above 20 knots, use the following phraseology, supplemented as appropriate with the phraseology in paragraph 3 − 7 − 2 , Taxi and Ground Movement Operations. PHRASEOLOGY − AIR-TAXI: VIA (direct, as requested, or specified route) TO (location, heliport, helipad, operating/movement area, active/inactive runway). AVOID (aircraft/vehicles/personnel).

LAND AND CONTACT TOWER, or HOLD FOR (reason − takeoff clearance, release, landing/taxiing aircraft, etc.). NOTE − Air-taxi is the preferred method for helicopter movements on airports provided ground operations/conditions permit. Air-taxi authorizes the pilot to proceed above the surface either via hover-taxi or flight at speeds more than 20 knots.

Issue landing clearances to helicopters going to movement areas other than active runways or from diverse directions to points on active runways, with additional instructions as necessary. Whenever possible, issue a landing clearance in lieu of extended hover − taxi or air − taxi operations. PHRASEOLOGY − MAKE APPROACH STRAIGHT − IN/CIRCLING LEFT/RIGHT TURN TO (location, runway, taxiway, helipad, Maltese cross) ARRIVAL/ARRIVAL ROUTE (number, name, or code). HOLD SHORT OF (active runway, extended runway centerline, other). REMAIN (direction/distance; e.g., 700 feet, 1 1/2 miles) OF/FROM (runway, runway centerline, other helicopter/aircraft). CAUTION (power lines, unlighted obstructions, wake turbulence, etc.). CLEARED TO LAND. b. If landing is requested to non-movement areas, an area not authorized for helicopter use, or an area off the airport, and, in your judgment, the operation appears to be reasonable, use the following phraseology instead of the landing clearance in subparagraph a. PHRASEOLOGY − LANDING AT (requested location) WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK (additional instructions, as necessary). USE CAUTION (if applicable). c. Unless agreed to by the pilot, do not issue downwind landings if the tailwind exceeds 5 knots. NOTE − A pilot request to land at a given point from a given direction constitutes agreement.

The assignment of an initial heading using a DVA can be given to the pilot as part of the initial clearance, but must be given no later than with the takeoff clearance. Once airborne, an aircraft assigned headings within the DVA can be vectored below the MVA/MIA. Controllers cannot interrupt an aircraft’s climb in the DVA until the aircraft is at or above the MVA/MIA. NOTE − 1. It is important for controllers to understand that there can be differences in published climb gradients applicable to individual departure procedures serving the same airport or runway. Assigning a different departure procedure without the pilot being able to re − brief may result in the pilot rejecting the new procedure. 2. When a departure clearance includes a SID, concurrent use of a diverse vector area (DVA) is not permitted. REFERENCE − AIM, Para 5 − 2 − 7, Departure Control. AIM, Para 5 − 2 − 9, Instrument Departure Procedures (DP) − Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departures (SID). (b) Locations without Airport Traffic Control Service, but within a Class E surface area \u0002 specify direction of takeoff/turn or initial heading if necessary. Obtain/solicit the pilot’s concurrence concerning a turn or heading before issuing them in a clearance. NOTE − Direction of takeoff and turn after takeoff can be obtained/solicited directly from the pilot, or relayed by an FSS, dispatcher, etc., as obtained/solicited from the pilot. (c) At all other airports − Do not specify direction of takeoff/turn after takeoff. If necessary to specify an initial heading to be flown after takeoff, issue the initial heading so as to apply only within controlled airspace. 2. Where an ODP has been published for a location and pilot compliance is necessary to ensure separation, include the procedure as part of the ATC clearance. Additionally, when an ODP is included in the clearance and the Visual Climb over Airport (VCOA) is requested by the pilot or assigned by ATC when it is the only procedure published in the ODP, include an instruction to remain within the published visibility of the VCOA. EXAMPLE − “Depart via the (airport name)(runway number) obstacle departure procedure. Remain within (number of miles) miles of the (airport name) during visual climb” if applicable. Or, “Depart via the (graphic ODP name) obstacle departure procedure. Remain within (number of miles) miles of the (airport name) during visual climb” if applicable. NOTE − 1. Pilots will advise ATC of their intent to use the VCOA option when requesting their IFR clearance. 2. Some aircraft are required by 14 CFR 91.175 to depart a runway under IFR using the ODP absent other instructions from ATC. 3. IFR takeoff minimums and obstacle departure procedures are prescribed for specific airports/runways and published in either a textual, or graphic form with the label (OBSTACLE) in the procedure title, and documented on an appropriate FAA Form 8260.

Any other time that authorization to descend at pilot’s discretion is intended, it must be specifically stated by the controller. 3. The pilot may need to know of any future restrictions that might affect the descent, including those that may be issued in another sector, in order to properly plan a descent at pilot’s discretion. 4. Controllers need to be aware that the descent rates in the AIM are only suggested and aircraft will not always descend at those rates. REFERENCE − P/CG Term − Pilot’s Discretion. e. When a portion of a climb/descent may be authorized at the pilot’s discretion, specify the altitude the aircraft must climb/descend to followed by the altitude to maintain at the pilot’s discretion. PHRASEOLOGY − CLIMB/DESCEND NOW TO (altitude), THEN CLIMB/DESCEND AT PILOT’S DISCRETION MAINTAIN (altitude). EXAMPLE − “United Three Ten, descend now to flight level two eight zero, then descend at pilot’s discretion maintain flight level two four zero.” NOTE − 1. The pilot is expected to commence descent upon receipt of the clearance and to descend as prescribed in the AIM, paragraph 4 − 4 − 10, Adherence to Clearance, until FL 280. At that point, the pilot is authorized to continue descent to FL 240 within context of the term “at pilot’s discretion” as described in the AIM. 2. Controllers need to be aware that the descent rates are only suggested and aircraft will not always descend at those rates. f. When the “pilot’s discretion” portion of a climb/descent clearance is being canceled by assigning a new altitude, inform the pilot that the new altitude is an “amended altitude.” EXAMPLE − “American Eighty Three, amend altitude, descend and maintain Flight Level"

Clearance to “descent via” authorizes pilots: 1. To descend at pilot discretion to meet published restrictions on a STAR. Pilots navigating on a STAR must maintain the last assigned altitude until receiving clearance to descend via. Once leaving an altitude, the pilot may not return to that altitude without an ATC clearance. 2. When cleared direct to a waypoint, to descend at pilot discretion to meet restrictions on the procedure. ATC assumes obstacle clearance responsibility for aircraft not yet established or taken off of a procedure. 3. To adjust speeds prior to reaching waypoints with published speed restrictions. NOTE − When cleared for SIDs that contain published speed restrictions, the pilot must comply with those speed restrictions independent of any “climb via” clearance. Clearance to “climb via” authorizes pilots: 1. When used in the IFR departure clearance, in a PDC, DCL or when subsequently cleared after departure to a waypoint depicted on a SID, to join a procedure after departure or resume a procedure. 2. When vertical navigation is interrupted and an altitude is assigned to maintain which is not contained on the published procedure, to climb from that previously-assigned altitude at pilot’s discretion to the altitude depicted for the next waypoint. ATC must ensure obstacle clearance until the aircraft is established on the lateral and vertical path of the SID. 3.

When delay is expected, issue items in subparagraphs a and b at least 5 minutes before the aircraft is estimated to reach the clearance limit. If the traffic situation requires holding an aircraft that is less than 5 minutes from the holding fix, issue these items immediately. NOTE − 1. The AIM indicates that pilots should start speed reduction when 3 minutes or less from the holding fix.

RADIO FREQUENCY AND RADAR BEACON CHANGES FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT When military single-piloted turbojet aircraft will conduct an approach wholly or partly in IFR conditions or at night, take the following action: NOTE − It is known that the mental distraction and the inadvertent movement of aircraft controls resulting from the pilot’s turning, reaching, or leaning to change frequencies can induce spatial disorientation (vertigo). a. Avoid radio frequency and radar beacon changes to the maximum extent that communications capabilities and traffic will permit. However, when changes are required: 1. Give instructions early enough to allow the change before the aircraft reaches the approach fix or handoff point. 2. Keep frequency/radar beacon changes to a minimum below 2,500 feet above the surface. 3. Avoid requiring frequency/radar beacon changes during the time the aircraft is making a turn. b. When traffic volume requires, a frequency other than the one used by aircraft making approaches may be assigned for use in transferring control to the approach control facility.

MILITARY TURBOJET EN ROUTE DESCENT Provide military turbojet aircraft the same arrival procedures that are provided for nonmilitary turbojet aircraft except: NOTE − It is the responsibility of the pilot to request a high altitude approach if he/she does not want normal arrival handling. a. An en route descent may be used in a nonradar environment; however, radar capability should exist which will permit the aircraft to be vectored to the final approach course of a published high altitude instrument approach procedure or PAR/ASR approach. Do not use this procedure if other than normal vectoring delays are anticipated. b. Prior to issuance of a descent clearance below the highest initial approach fix altitude established for any high altitude instrument approach procedure for the destination airport inform the aircraft: 1. Type of approach to expect. EXAMPLE − “Expect V − O − R approach to runway three two.” 2. Radar vectors will be provided to the final approach course. EXAMPLE − “Expect surveillance/precision approach to runway one seven; radar vectors to final approach course.” 3. Current weather whenever the ceiling is below 1,000 feet ( USAF: 1,500 feet) or the highest circling minimum whichever is greater, or when the visibility is less than 3 miles. EXAMPLE − “Expect ILS approach to runway eight; radar vectors to localizer course. Weather (reported weather).” c. If ATIS is provided and the pilot advises he/she has received the current ATIS broadcast before the descent clearance in subparagraph b is issued, omit those items in subparagraph b that are contained in the broadcast. d. To avoid requiring an aircraft to fly at low altitudes for an excessive distance, descent clearance should be issued at a point determined by adding 10 to the first two digits of the flight level.

If only one instrument approach of a particular type is published, the approach needs not be identified by the runway reference. 2. An aircraft conducting an ILS or LDA approach must be advised at the time an approach clearance is issued when the glideslope is reported out of service, unless the title of the published approach procedure allows (for example, ILS or LOC Rwy 05). 3. Standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP) must begin at an initial approach fix (IAF) or an intermediate fix (IF) if there is not an IAF. 4.

Mode 3/A is designated as the common military/civil mode for air traffic control use. 2. Make beacon code assignments to only ADS − B and/or transponder − equipped aircraft. NOTE − Aircraft equipped with ADS − B are also still required to have an operable transponder. The ATC − assigned beacon code is one of the required message elements of ADS − B Out. b. Unless otherwise specified in this section, a facility directive, or a letter of agreement, issue beacon codes assigned by the computer. Computer − assigned codes may be modified as required. NOTE − The computer will assign only discrete beacon codes unless all the discrete codes allocated to a facility are in use. 1. TERMINAL. Aircraft that will remain within the terminal facility’s delegated airspace must be assigned a code from the code subset allocated to the terminal facility. 2. TERMINAL. Unless otherwise specified in a facility directive or a letter of agreement, aircraft that will enter an adjacent facility’s delegated airspace must be assigned a beacon code assigned by the ARTCC computer. NOTE − This will provide the adjacent facility advance information on the aircraft and will cause auto − acquisition of the aircraft prior to handoff. When an airborne aircraft that has been assigned a beacon code by the ARTCC computer and whose flight plan will terminate in another facility’s area cancels ATC service, appropriate action should be taken to remove flight plan information on that aircraft. PHRASEOLOGY − SQUAWK THREE/ALFA (code), or SQUAWK (code). REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5 − 3 − 3 , Beacon/ADS − B Identification Methods. FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5 − 3 − 4 , Terminal Automation Systems Identification Methods. c. Code 4000 should be assigned when aircraft are operating on a flight plan specifying frequent or rapid changes in assigned altitude in more than one stratum or other category of flight not compatible with a discrete code assignment. NOTE − 1. Categories of flight that can be assigned Code 4000 include certain flight test aircraft, MTR missions, aerial refueling operation requiring descent involving more than one stratum, ALTRVs where continuous monitoring of ATC frequencies is not required and frequent altitude changes are approved, and other flights requiring special handling by ATC. 2. Military aircraft operating in restricted/warning areas or on VR routes will squawk 4000 unless another code has been assigned or coordinated with ATC. 5 − 2 − 2. RADAR BEACON CODE CHANGES Unless otherwise specified in a directive or a letter of agreement or coordinated at the time of handoff, do not request an aircraft to change from the code it was squawking in the transferring facility’s area until the aircraft is within your area of responsibility.

PRIMARY RADAR IDENTIFICATION METHODS Identify a primary, radar beacon, or ADS − B target by using one of the following methods: a. Observing a departing aircraft target within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end at airports with an operating control tower, provided one of the following methods of coordination is accomplished. 1. A verbal rolling/boundary notification is issued for each departure, or 2. A nonverbal rolling/boundary notification is used for each departure aircraft. NOTE − Nonverbal notification can be accomplished via the use of a manual or electronic “drop tube” or automation. b. Observing a target whose position with respect to a fix (displayed on the video map, scribed on the map overlay, or displayed as a permanent echo) or a visual reporting point (whose range and azimuth from the radar antenna has been accurately determined and made available to the controller) corresponds with a direct position report received from an aircraft, and the observed track is consistent with the reported heading or route of flight. If a TACAN/VORTAC is located within 6,000 feet of the radar antenna, the TACAN/VORTAC may be used as a reference fix for radar identification without being displayed on the video map or map overlay. NOTE − 1. Establishment of radar identification through use of DME position information can be complicated by the fact that some military TACANs are not collocated with frequency − paired VORs and might be separated from them by as much as 31 miles. 2. Visual reporting points used for RADAR identification are limited to those most used by pilots and whose range and azimuth have been determined by supervisory personnel. c. Observing a target make an identifying turn or turns of 30 degrees or more, provided the following conditions are met: NOTE − Use of identifying turns or headings which would cause the aircraft to follow normal IFR routes or known VFR flight paths might result in misidentification. When these circumstances cannot be avoided, additional methods of identification may be necessary. 1. Except in the case of a lost aircraft, a pilot position report is received which assures you that the aircraft is within radar coverage and within the area being displayed. 2. Only one aircraft is observed making these turns. 3. For aircraft operating in accordance with an IFR clearance, you either issue a heading away from an area which will require an increased minimum IFR altitude or have the aircraft climb to the highest minimum"

APPLICATION To provide continuous radar service to an aircraft and facilitate a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of traffic, it is often necessary to transfer radar identification of an aircraft from one controller to another. This section describes the terms, methods, and responsibilities associated with this task. Interfacility and intrafacility transfers of radar identification must be accomplished in all areas of radar surveillance except where it is not operationally feasible. Where such constraints exist, they must be: a. Covered in letters of agreement which clearly state that control will not be based upon a radar handoff, or b. Coordinated by the transferring and receiving controllers for a specified period of time. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4 − 3 − 8 , Coordination with Receiving Facility. 5 − 4 − 2. TERMS a. Handoff. An action taken to transfer the radar identification of an aircraft from one controller to another controller if the aircraft will enter the receiving controller’s airspace and radio communications with the aircraft will be transferred. b. Radar Contact. The term used to inform the controller initiating a handoff that the aircraft is identified and approval is granted for the aircraft to enter the receiving controller’s airspace. c. Point Out. An action taken by a controller to transfer the radar identification of an aircraft to another controller and radio communications will not be transferred. d. Point Out Approved. The term used to inform the controller initiating a point out that the aircraft is identified and that approval is granted for the aircraft to enter the receiving controller’s airspace, as coordinated, without a communications transfer or the appropriate automated system response. e. Traffic. A term used to transfer radar identification of an aircraft to another controller for the purpose of coordinating separation action. Traffic is normally issued: 1. In response to a handoff or point out; 2. In anticipation of a handoff or point out; or 3. In conjunction with a request for control of an aircraft. f. Traffic Observed. The term used to inform the controller issuing the traffic restrictions that the traffic is identified and that the restrictions issued are understood and will be complied with. 5 − 4 − 3. METHODS a. Transfer the radar identification of an aircraft by at least one of the following methods: 1. Physically point to the target on the receiving controller’s display. 2. Use landline voice communications. 3. Use automation capabilities. NOTE − Automated handoff capabilities are only available when FDP is operational. 4. TERMINAL. Use the “Modify” or “Quick Look” functions for data transfer between the TRACON and tower cab only if specific procedures are established in a facility directive. The local controller has the responsibility to determine whether or not conditions are adequate for the use of STARS data on the TDW. Transfer of Radar Identification 5 − 4 − 1"

Avoid adjustments requiring alternate decreases and increases. Terminate speed adjustments when no longer needed. NOTE − It is the pilot’s responsibility and prerogative to refuse speed adjustment that he/she considers excessive or contrary to the aircraft’s operating specifications. a. Consider the following when applying speed control: 1. Determine the interval required and the point at which the interval is to be accomplished. 2. Implement speed adjustment based on the following principles. (a) Priority of speed adjustment instructions is determined by the relative speed and position of the aircraft involved and the spacing requirement. (b) Speed adjustments are not achieved instantaneously. Aircraft configuration, altitudes, and speed determine the time and distance required to accomplish the adjustment. 3. Use the following techniques in speed control situations: (a) Compensate for compression when assigning air speed adjustment in an in-trail situation by using one of the following techniques: (1) Reduce the trailing aircraft first. (2) Increase the leading aircraft first. (b) Assign a specific airspeed if required to maintain spacing. (c) Allow increased time and distance to achieve speed adjustments in the following situations: (1) Higher altitudes. (2) Greater speed. (3) Clean configurations. (d) Ensure that aircraft are allowed to operate in a clean configuration as long as circumstances permit. (e) Keep the number of speed adjustments per aircraft to the minimum required to achieve and maintain spacing. b. Do not assign speed adjustment to aircraft: 1.

When issuing speed adjustments to aircraft cleared along a route or procedure that has published speed restrictions, if feasible, advise the pilot where you intend on allowing the aircraft to resume the published speed. NOTE − If it is anticipated that an aircraft will be allowed to resume the published speeds on a procedure, advising the pilot where that may occur avoids flight crews from unnecessarily deleting speeds from the Flight Management System. g.

When vectoring a departing aircraft on a radar SID, concurrent use of a diverse vector area (DVA) is not permitted. b. When the departure route description on a radar SID contains the phrase, “Fly assigned heading,” “as assigned by ATC,” or similar phrases, with a published range of headings in the route description, assign headings or vectors as needed not to exceed those headings in the published range until reaching the MVA/MIA. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5 − 6 − 3 , Vectors Below Minimum Altitude. 5 − 8 − 2. INITIAL HEADING a. Before departure, assign the initial heading consistent with either a SID being flown or DVA, if applicable, when a departing aircraft is to be vectored immediately after takeoff. At locations that have a DVA, concurrent use of both a SID and DVA is not permitted. PHRASEOLOGY − FLY RUNWAY HEADING. TURN LEFT/RIGHT, HEADING (degrees). NOTE − 1. TERMINAL. A purpose for the heading is not necessary, since pilots operating in a radar environment associate assigned headings with vectors to their planned route of flight. 2. ATC assumes responsibility for terrain and obstacle avoidance when IFR aircraft are below the minimum IFR altitude (MVA, MIA, MEA) and are taken off departure/missed approach procedures, or if issued go − around instructions, except after conducting a visual approach. ATC does not assume this responsibility when utilizing a Diverse Vector Area (DVA) or when operating on SIDs with or without a published range of headings in the departure route description. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4 − 3 − 2 , Departure Clearances. FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5 − 6 − 3 , Vectors Below Minimum Altitude. b. At locations with both SIDs and DVAs, an amended departure clearance is required to cancel a previously assigned SID and subsequently utilize a DVA or vice versa. The amended clearance must be provided to the pilot in a timely manner so that the pilot may brief the changes in advance of entering the runway. c. Issue an altitude to maintain with the initial heading when the heading will take the aircraft off a departure procedure that contains both a published lateral path to a waypoint and crossing restrictions. d. When conducting simultaneous parallel runway departures utilizing RNAV SIDs, advise aircraft of the initial fix/waypoint on the RNAV route. PHRASEOLOGY − RNAV to (fix/waypoint), RUNWAY (number), CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. EXAMPLE − “RNAV to MPASS, Runway Two − Six Left, cleared for takeoff.” NOTE − 1. TERMINAL. A purpose for an initial waypoint advisory is not necessary since pilots associate this advisory with the flight path to their planned route of flight. Pilots must immediately advise ATC if a different RNAV SID is entered in the aircraft FMS. 2. The SID transition is not restated as it is contained in the ATC clearance. 3.

With non − VOR/DME based navigational equipment established on tracks of the same waypoint that diverge by at least 15 degrees when either aircraft is clear of the airspace to be protected for the other aircraft.

The aircraft depicted 6 miles from the NAVAID/waypoint would require vertical separation until reaching the 6 − mile point. Reversing direction, the same aircraft would require vertical separation before passing the 6 − mile point. Due to the nature of GPS equipment, issue crossing restrictions in reference to the next waypoint, since the pilot receives tracking “to” data rather than tracking “from” the last waypoint. b. Use TBL 6 − 5 − 1 and TBL 6 − 5 − 2 to determine the distance required for various divergence angles to clear the airspace to be protected. For divergence that falls between two values, use the lesser divergence value to obtain the distance. Lateral Separation 6 − 5 − 1"

VISUAL APPROACH A visual approach is an ATC authorization for an aircraft on an IFR flight plan to proceed visually and clear of clouds to the airport of intended landing. A visual approach is not a standard instrument approach procedure and has no missed approach segment. An aircraft unable to complete a landing from a visual approach must be handled as any go − around and appropriate IFR separation must be provided until the aircraft lands or the pilot cancels their IFR flight plan. a. At airports with an operating control tower, aircraft executing a go − around may be directed to: 1. Enter the traffic pattern for landing. An altitude assignment is not required. The pilot is expected to climb to pattern altitude and is responsible to maintain terrain and obstruction avoidance. ATC must provide approved separation or visual separation from other IFR aircraft, or 2. Proceed as otherwise instructed by ATC. The pilot is expected to comply with assigned instructions, and responsible to maintain terrain and obstruction avoidance until reaching an ATC assigned altitude. ATC is responsible to provide instructions to the pilot to facilitate a climb to the minimum altitude for instrument operations. ATC must provide approved separation or visual separation from other IFR aircraft. NOTE − The pilot is responsible for their own terrain and obstruction avoidance during a go − around after conducting a visual approach.

Altitudes: The aircraft concerned are in level, climbing or descending flight. d. Mach Number Assignment: 1. A Mach number (or, when appropriate, a range of Mach numbers) must be issued to each aircraft unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of ICAO regional agreement. NOTE − 1. The application of Mach number technique requires pilots to strictly adhere to the last assigned Mach number (or range of Mach numbers), even during climbs and descents, unless revised by ATC. Turbojet aircraft must request ATC approval before making any changes. If it is essential to make an immediate temporary change in the Mach number (e.g., due to turbulence), ATC must be notified as soon as possible that such a change has been made. 2. When it is necessary to issue crossing restrictions to ensure the appropriate time interval, it may be impossible for an aircraft to comply with both the clearance to meet the crossing restrictions and the clearance to maintain a single, specific Mach number.

Unless otherwise agreed to, maintain direct contact with the pilot and exchange information regarding known traffic in the area and his/her intentions. NOTE − 1. Many flight inspections are accomplished using automatic recording equipment, and an uninterrupted flight is necessary for successful completion of the mission. The workload for the limited number of aircraft engaged in these activities requires strict adherence to a schedule. 2. Flight inspection operations which require special participation of ground personnel, specific communications, or radar operation capabilities are considered to require special handling.

Do not ask the pilot to deviate from his/her planned action except to preclude an emergency situation. REFERENCE − FAA Order 8240.41, Flight Inspection/Air Traffic On-Site Coordination Requirements, Appendix 1, describes certain flight inspection maneuvers in detail. b. Issue radar advisories to the flight inspection aircraft where adequate coverage exists and to the extent permitted by workload. c. Suggest flight path adjustments, as required, for any aircraft which will enter or penetrate an area in which a flight inspection function is being performed. d. Provide special handling, as required, to FAA aircraft conducting flight inspections using the call sign “Flight Check.” Use of the term “recorded run” by Flight Check aircraft indicates automated flight inspections are in progress. NOTE − 1. Flight Check (FLC) aircraft stating “recorded run” indicates automated flight inspections are in progress. Such inspections necessitate the full length of the runway (including protection of any critical areas) and require the entire procedure to be flown, up to and including the missed approach as needed. Any interruption of a recorded run will require the entire procedure to be reinitiated. 2. Flight plan remarks may indicate type NAVAID inspection to be accomplished, e.g., “FC OKC P.” 3. Authorized non-FAA Service Providers conducting Flight Validation activities use the call sign “FLIGHT VAL.” Although these activities are similar to Flight Inspection activities, no additional priority is granted with this call sign. 9 − 1 − 3.

APPLICATION FIG 9 − 6 − 1 Shapes of 11 Million Cubic Feet Balloon at Various Altitudes Apply the following procedures, as appropriate, when unmanned free balloons are within airspace for which you have control jurisdiction: NOTE − These procedures apply to unmanned free balloons that carry payloads as described in 14 CFR section 101.1(a)(4). Payloads may weigh several hundred pounds and the physical shape of the balloons change at various altitudes/flight levels. (See FIG 9 − 6 − 1 .) Balloon and payload ascend at an average rate of 400 feet a minute. Over the descent area, the payload is normally released from the balloon and descends by parachute at a minimum rate of 1,000 feet a minute. The balloon is normally deflated automatically when the payload is released. The operator is required to advise ATC 1 hour in advance of descent in accordance with 14 CFR section 101.39. a. Post the balloon flight on flight progress strips along the planned trajectory and revise routing as tracking/position reports require. NOTE − The prelaunch notice information should be posted on flight progress strips for planning and operational purposes. b. Radar flight follow balloons to the extent that equipment capabilities permit. If radar flight following is not possible, tracking should be attempted by communication with the “chase plane,” telephone contact with the operator, pilot, or ground observation reports. NOTE − Some operators have equipped their balloons with transponder beacons in addition to a radar reflection device or material required by 14 CFR section 101.35, but at cruise altitude, the balloon’s communications equipment and transponder, if so equipped, are operated intermittently to conserve battery energy. c. With pilot concurrence, provide separation between aircraft and balloons when you are satisfied that the balloon information is sufficiently reliable to provide the service. Do not attempt to separate aircraft from the balloon by using vertical separation unless you have accurate balloon altitude information. d.

An emergency can be either a Distress or an Urgency condition as defined in the “Pilot/Controller Glossary.” b. A pilot who encounters a Distress condition should declare an emergency by beginning the initial communication with the word “Mayday,” preferably repeated three times. For an Urgency condition, the word “Pan-Pan” should be used in the same manner. c. If the words “Mayday” or “Pan − Pan” are not used but you believe an emergency or an urgent situation exists, handle it as though it were an emergency. d. Because of the infinite variety of possible emergency situations, specific procedures cannot be prescribed. However, when you believe an emergency exists or is imminent, select and pursue a course of action which appears to be most appropriate under the circumstances and which most nearly conforms to the instructions in this manual. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9 − 2 − 6 , IFR Military Training Routes. 10 − 1 − 2. OBTAINING INFORMATION a. Use the information provided or solicit more information as necessary to assist the distressed aircraft. Provide assistance that is consistent with the requests of the pilot. If you believe an alternative course of action may prove more beneficial, transmit your recommendation(s) to the pilot. REFERENCE − 14 CFR § 91.3, Responsibilities and authority of pilot in command. b. If an emergency was declared by an Emergency Autoland system, the aircraft may transmit the following: 1. Callsign. 2. That Emergency Autoland has been activated. 3. Position (mileage and direction) relative to a nearby airport. 4. The intended emergency landing airport and the planned landing runway. 5. An ETE to the emergency landing airport. EXAMPLE − “Aircraft, N123B, pilot incapacitation, 12 miles southwest of KOJC, landing KIXD airport. Emergency Autoland in 13 minutes on runway 36.” NOTE − 1. System configurations may vary between manufacturers. All systems should be configured to transmit enough information for the controller to respond effectively to the emergency. 2. In the event of frequency congestion, an Emergency Autoland system may transmit on 121.5 or CTAF instead of the last assigned ATC frequency. 10 − 1 − 3.

The design and complexity of military fighter-type aircraft places an extremely high workload on the pilot during an inflight emergency. The pilot’s full attention is required to maintain control of the aircraft. Therefore, radio frequency and transponder code changes should be avoided and radio transmissions held to a minimum, especially when the aircraft experiencing the emergency is at low altitude. b. Pilots of military fighter − type aircraft, normally single engine, experiencing or anticipating loss of engine power or control may execute a flameout pattern in an emergency situation. Circumstances may dictate that the pilot, depending on the position and nature of the emergency, modify the pattern based on actual emergency recovery requirements. c. Military airfields with an assigned flying mission may conduct practice emergency approaches. Participating units maintain specific procedures for conducting these operations.

When communication from an aircraft has not been received within 30 minutes after the time a communication should have been received or after the time an unsuccessful attempt to establish communication with such aircraft was first made, whichever is earlier; or 2. When an aircraft fails to arrive within 30 minutes after the time of arrival last estimated by the pilot or by the ATC units, whichever is later. b. Alert phase (ALERFA). When there is apprehension about the safety of an aircraft and its occupants, an ALERFA exists: 1. Following the uncertainty phase when subsequent attempts to establish communications with the aircraft, or inquiries to other relevant sources have failed to reveal any information about the aircraft; or 2. When information has been received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired but not to the extent that a forced landing is likely; or 3. When communication from an aircraft has not been received within 60 minutes after the time a communication should have been received or after the time an unsuccessful attempt to establish communication with such aircraft was first made, whichever is earlier. c. Distress phase (DETRESFA). When there is reasonable certainty that the aircraft and its occupants are threatened by grave and imminent danger, a DETRESFA exists: 1. Following the alert phase when further attempts to establish communications with the aircraft and more widespread inquiries are unsuccessful; or 2. When the fuel on board is considered to be exhausted or to be insufficient for the aircraft to reach safety; or 3. When information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired to the extent that a forced landing is likely; or 4. When information is received or it is reasonably certain that the aircraft is about to make or has made a forced landing. 10 − 6 − 3. ALERTING SERVICE AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE a. Provide alerting service to: 1. All aircraft receiving ATC service; 2. All other aircraft which have filed a flight plan or which are otherwise known to the ATC unit; and 3. Any aircraft known or believed to be the subject of unlawful interference. b.

Continuously review TBM operations and TMIs affecting their area of responsibility and coordinate with OS/CIC and TMU for extensions, revisions, or cancellations. 4. Where authorized, perform data entries to keep the activation status of designated EDST Airspace Configuration Elements current. 5. Perform assigned actions in the event of an EDST outage or degradation, in accordance with the requirements of FAA Order JO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, and as designated by facility directive. d. ARTCCs, unless otherwise coordinated, must: 1. Support TBFM operations and monitor TBFM equipment to improve situational awareness for a system approach to TBM operations. 2. Monitor arrival flow for potential metering actions/changes and, if necessary, initiate coordination with all facilities to discuss the change to the metering plan. e. TRACONs, unless otherwise coordinated, must: 1. Support TBFM operations and monitor TBFM equipment to improve situational awareness for a system approach to TBM operations. 2. Monitor arrival flow for potential metering actions/changes and, if necessary, initiate coordination with all facilities to discuss the change to the metering plan. 3. Schedule internal departures in accordance with specific written procedures and agreements developed with overlying ARTCCs and adjacent facilities. f. ATCTs, unless otherwise coordinated, must: 1. Monitor TBFM equipment to improve situational awareness for a system approach to TBM operations. 2. When equipped, and departure scheduling is in effect, use automation to obtain a departure release time from the TBM system. 3.

APPLICATION Where control responsibility within Canadian airspace has been formally delegated to the FAA by the Transport Canada Aviation Group, apply basic FAA procedures except for the Canadian procedures contained in this chapter. NOTE − In 1985, the U.S. and Canada established an agreement recognizing the inherent safety of the ATC procedures exercised by the other country. This agreement permits the use of ATC procedures of one country when that country is exercising ATC in the airspace over the territory of the other country insofar as they are not inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the laws and regulations or unique operational requirements of the country over whose territory such airspace is located. Accordingly, this chapter was revised to include only those Canadian procedures that must be used because of a Canadian regulatory or unique operational requirement. 12 − 1 − 2. AIRSPACE CLASSIFICATION a. Class A airspace. Controlled airspace within which only IFR flights are permitted. Airspace designated from the base of all controlled high level airspace up to and including FL 600. b. Class B airspace. Controlled airspace within which only IFR and Controlled VFR (CVFR) flights are permitted. Includes all controlled low level airspace above 12,500 feet ASL or at and above the minimum en route IFR altitude, (whichever is higher) up to but not including 18,000 feet ASL. ATC procedures pertinent to IFR flights must be applied to CVFR aircraft. NOTE − The CVFR pilot is responsible to maintain VFR flight and visual reference to the ground at all times. c. Class C airspace. Controlled airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but VFR flights require a clearance from ATC to enter. d. Class D airspace. Controlled airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but VFR flights do not require a clearance from ATC to enter, however, they must establish two − way communications with the appropriate ATC agency prior to entering the airspace. e. Class E airspace. Airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but for VFR flight there are no special requirements. f. Class F airspace. Airspace of defined dimensions within which activities must be confined because of their nature, or within which limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or both. Special use airspace may be classified as Class F advisory or Class F restricted. g. Class G airspace. Uncontrolled airspace within which ATC has neither the authority nor responsibility for exercising control over air traffic. 12 − 1 − 3.

DESCRIPTION En Route Decision Support Tool (EDST) is an integrated function of ERAM that is used by the sector team in performing its strategic planning responsibilities. EDST uses current plan data, forecast winds, aircraft performance characteristics, and track data to derive expected aircraft trajectories, and to predict conflicts between aircraft and between aircraft and special use or designated airspace. It also provides trial planning and enhanced flight data management capabilities. NOTE − For use by the EDST, the current plan is what the En Route Automation System (EAS) predicts an aircraft will fly. This may include clearances that have not yet been issued to the aircraft. Current plans are used to model a flight trajectory and, when applicable, for detecting conflicts. 13 − 1 − 2. CONFLICT DETECTION AND RESOLUTION a. Actively scan EDST information for predicted aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-airspace alerts. b. When a conflict probe alert is displayed, evaluate the alert and take appropriate action as early as practical, in accordance with duty priorities. c. Prioritize the evaluation and resolution of conflict probe alerts to ensure the safe, expeditious, and efficient flow of air traffic. NOTE − Conflict probe alerts are based on approved radar separation. Conflict probe does not account for instances in which greater separation may be needed (e.g., non − standard formations, A380) or where reduced separation is permitted (e.g., 3 mile airspace). d. When a conflict probe alert is displayed and when sector priorities permit, give consideration to the following in determining a solution: 1. Solutions that involve direct routing, altitude changes, removal of a flight direction constraint (i.e., inappropriate altitude for direction of flight), and/or removal of a static restriction for one or more pertinent aircraft. 2. Impact on surrounding sector traffic and complexity levels, flight efficiencies, and user preferences. e. When the Stop Probe feature is activated for an aircraft, conflict probe for that aircraft must be restarted before transfer of control, unless otherwise coordinated. NOTE − The requirement in subparagraph 13 − 1 − 2 e does not apply to aircraft entering a non EDST facility. 13 − 1 − 3. TRIAL PLANNING When EDST is operational at the sector and when sector priorities permit, use the trial plan capability to evaluate: a. Solutions to predicted conflicts. b. The feasibility of granting user requests. c. The feasibility of removing a flight direction constraint (i.e., inappropriate altitude for direction of flight) for an aircraft. d. The feasibility of removing a static restriction for an aircraft. ERAM − En Route 13 − 1 − 1"

(b) Controllers must continue to ensure that separation is maintained until the overridden conflict is resolved. 4. Use of Probe when Issuing Clearances. Utilize conflict probe results when issuing a clearance to ensure that any potential conflict has been given thorough consideration. 5. Use of Probe when Accepting Manual Transfers. Prior to manually accepting an aircraft transfer from an external facility ensure that the coordinated flight profile is accurately entered, conflict probe initiated and, if necessary, action is taken to resolve any potential conflicts. 6. Trial Probe. The controller can utilize trial probe to assess whether there are any potential conflicts with a proposed clearance or when performing manual coordination. NOTE − Once initiated, trial probe does not take into account any changes made to the proposed profile or to any other flight profile in the system. It is an assessment by conflict probe of the current situation at the time the controller enters the trial probe. A trial probe does not alleviate the controller from performing a conflict probe when issuing a clearance or accepting a transfer. 7. System Unable to Perform Conflict Probe for a Specific Aircraft. (a) If a flight’s profile becomes corrupted, conflict probe may not be able to correctly monitor separation for that flight. Take the necessary steps to correct an aircraft’s flight plan when conflict probe could not be performed. (b) In addition, after verifying flight plan data accuracy, utilize other decision support tools to establish and maintain the appropriate separation minima until such time that conflict probe can be utilized. 8.

In accordance with facility directives, ensure that the messages directed to the error queue are processed in a timely manner. e. Window/List Management. 1. Ensure that the situation display window title bar is not obscured by other windows and/or lists. NOTE − The title bar changes color to denote when priority information on the ASD is being obscured or is out of view. 2. In accordance with facility directives, ensure that designated windows and/or lists are displayed at all times. 13 − 2 − 4. CONTROLLER PILOT DATA LINK COMMUNICATIONS (CPDLC) a. Means of communication. 1. When CPDLC is available and CPDLC connected aircraft are operating outside of VHF coverage, CPDLC must be used as the primary means of communication. 2. Voice communications may be utilized for CPDLC aircraft when it will provide an operational advantage and/or when workload or equipment capabilities demand. 3. When CPDLC is being utilized, a voice backup must exist (e.g., HF, SATCOM, Third party). 4. When a pilot communicates via CPDLC, the response should be via CPDLC. 5. To the extent possible, the CPDLC message set should be used in lieu of free text messages. ATOP − Oceanic 13 − 2 − 3"

When the receiving facility is capable of CPDLC communications, the data link transfer is automatic and is accomplished within facility adapted parameters. 2. When a receiving facility is not CPDLC capable, the transfer of communications must be made in accordance with local directives and Letters of Agreement (LOAs). c. Abnormal conditions. 1. If any portion of the automated transfer fails, the controller should attempt to initiate the transfer manually. If unable to complete the data link transfer, the controller should advise the pilot to log on to the next facility and send an End Service (EOS) message. 2. If CPDLC fails, voice communications must be utilized until CPDLC connections can be reestablished. 3. If the CPDLC connection is lost on a specific aircraft, the controller should send a connection request message (CR1) or advise the pilot via backup communications to log on again. 4. If CPDLC service is to be canceled, the controller must advise the pilot as early as possible to facilitate a smooth transition to voice communications. Workload permitting, the controller should also advise the pilot of the reason for the termination of data link. 5. When there is uncertainty that a clearance was delivered to an aircraft via CPDLC, the controller must continue to protect the airspace associated with the clearance until an appropriate operational response is received from the flight crew. If an expected operational response to a clearance is not received, the controller will initiate appropriate action to ensure that the clearance was received by the flight crew. On initial voice contact with aircraft preface the message with the following: PHRASEOLOGY − (Call Sign) CPDLC Failure, (message). 13 − 2 − 5. COORDINATION In addition to the requirements set forth in Chapter 8, Offshore/Oceanic Procedures, Section 2, Coordination, automated coordination must constitute complete coordination between ATOP sectors, both internally and between sectors across adjacent ATOP facilities, except: a. When the aircraft is in conflict with another in the receiving sector, or b. When otherwise specified in facility directives or LOA. 13 − 2 − 6. TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES − MULTIPLE PERSON OPERATION a.

PURPOSE This appendix prescribes the method and step − by − step process for conducting a position relief briefing and transferring position responsibility from one specialist to another. 2. DISCUSSION a. In all operational facilities, the increase in traffic density and the need for the expeditious movement of traffic without compromising safety have emphasized the importance of the position relief process. b. The contents, methods, and practices used for position relief and briefings vary among personnel, and pertinent information is often forgotten or incompletely covered. Major problems occur whenever there is a heavy reliance upon memory, unsupported by routines or systematic reminders. This SOP addresses the complete task of transferring position responsibility and the associated relief briefing. c. Position relief unavoidably provides workload for specialists at the time of relief. The intent of this SOP is to make the transfer of position responsibility take place smoothly and to ensure a complete transfer of information with a minimum amount of workload. The method takes advantage of a self − briefing concept in which the relieving specialist obtains needed status information by reading from the Status Information Area/s to begin the relief process. Up to the moment information related to the control of aircraft or vehicular movements requires verbal exchanges between specialists during the relief process. The method also specifies the moment when the transfer of position responsibility occurs. d. In the final part of the relief process, the specialist being relieved monitors and reviews the position to ensure that nothing has been overlooked or incorrectly displayed and that the transfer of position responsibility occurred with a complete briefing. 3. TERMS The following terms are important for a complete understanding of this SOP: a. Status Information Area (SIA). Manual or automatic displays of the current status of position related equipment and operational conditions or procedures. b. Written Notes. Manually recorded items of information kept at designated locations on the position of operation. They may be an element of the Status Information Area/s. c. Checklist. An ordered listing of items to be covered during a position relief. 4. PRECAUTIONS a. Specialists involved in the position relief process should not rush or be influenced to rush. b. During position operation, each item of status information which is or may be an operational factor for the relieving specialist should be recorded as soon as it is operationally feasible so that it will not be forgotten or incorrectly recorded. c. Extra care should be taken when more than one specialist relieves or is being relieved from a position at the same time; e.g., combining or decombining positions. Such simultaneous reliefs should be approached with caution. 5. RESPONSIBILITIES a. The specialist being relieved must be responsible for ensuring that any pertinent status information of which he/she is aware is relayed to the relieving specialist and is either: 1. Accurately displayed in the Status Information Area/s for which he/she has responsibility, or"

The relieving specialist and the specialist being relieved must share equal responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the position relief briefing. d. The specialists engaged in a position relief must conduct the relief process at the position being relieved unless other procedures have been established and authorized by the facility air traffic manager. NOTE − The “sharing” of this responsibility means that the specialist being relieved is obligated to provide a complete, accurate briefing and the relieving specialist is obligated to ensure that a briefing takes place and is to his/her total satisfaction. 6. STEP − BY − STEP PROCESS a. PREVIEW THE POSITION Relieving Specialist Specialist Being Relieved 1. Follow checklist and review the Status Information Area(s). NOTE − This sub-step may be replaced by an authorized pre − position briefing provided an equivalent review of checklist items is accomplished. 2. Observe position equipment, operational situation, and the work environment. 3. Listen to voice communications and observe other operational actions. 4. Observe current and pending aircraft and vehicular traffic and correlate with flight and other movement information. 5. Indicate to the specialist being relieved that the position has been previewed and that the verbal briefing may begin. NOTE − Substeps 6a2, 3, and 4 may be conducted concurrently or in any order. b. VERBAL BRIEFING Relieving Specialist Specialist Being Relieved 5. Ask questions necessary to ensure a complete understanding of the operational situation. 1. Brief the relieving specialist on the abnormal status of items not listed on the Status Information Area(s) as well as on any items of special interest calling for verbal explanation or additional discussion. 2. Brief on reported weather and other weather related information. 3. Brief on traffic if applicable. 4.

Standard Operating Practice (SOP) for Aircraft Deviating for Weather Near Active Special Activity Airspace (SAA) The procedures listed below must be applied and contained in a facility SOP when aircraft deviate into and/or near an active or scheduled SAA: 1. PURPOSE This appendix prescribes the method and step − by − step process for handling aircraft deviations for weather near active Special Activity Airspace (SAA). The procedures are intended to work in parallel to the preventive procedures outlined in FAA Order JO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, subparagraph 18 − 2 − 4a9, which must be applied when weather is scheduled to impact an active or scheduled SAA. 2. DISCUSSION a. In all operational facilities, the increase in traffic density and the need for the expeditious movement of traffic without compromising safety have emphasized the importance of handling aircraft deviations for weather in the vicinity of active SAA. b. The methods, and practices used for handling aircraft requesting or initiating deviations off of their filed route due to weather require time critical responses to the request or in response to observed course deviations. Major issues can occur whenever there is a heavy reliance upon reactive control actions when not performed according to this handbook and the procedures outlined in FAA Order JO 7210.3. c. Course deviations in areas near active SAA’s increase the workload for specialists at the time of their request or observation. The intent of this SOP is to make the handling of the requested deviation or to correct the observed course deviation take place smoothly and to ensure a safe operation with a minimum amount of workload. 3. TERMS The following terms are important for a complete understanding of this SOP: a. Status Information Area (SIA). Manual or automatic displays of the current status of position related equipment and operational conditions or procedures. b. Special Activity Airspace (SAA). Airspace with defined dimensions within the National Airspace System wherein limitations may be imposed upon operations for national defense, homeland security, public interest, or public safety. Special activity airspace includes but is not limited to the following: Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), Altitude Reservations (ALTRV), Military Training Routes (MTR), Air Refueling Tracks and Anchors, Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR), Special Security Instructions (SSI), etc. Special Use Airspace (SUA) is a subset of Special Activity Airspace. c. Deviation. A departure from a current clearance, such as an off course maneuver to avoid weather or turbulence. d. Using Agency. The using agency is the military unit or other organization whose activity established the requirement for the SAA. The using agency is responsible for ensuring that: 1. The airspace is used only for its designated purpose. 2. Proper scheduling procedures are established and utilized. 3. The controlling agency is kept informed of changes in scheduled activity, to include the completion of activities for the day. 4. A point of contact is made available to enable the controlling agency to verify schedules, and coordinate access for emergencies, weather"

An ATC facility may be designated as the using agency for joint − use areas when that facility has been granted priority for use of the airspace in a joint − use letter of procedure or letter of agreement. NOTE − Not every SAA has a using agency as defined in FAA Order JO 7400.2. REFERENCE − FAA Order JO 7400.2, Para 21 − 1 − 11, Using Agency. 4. PRECAUTIONS a. Unless clearance of nonparticipating aircraft in/through/adjacent to an active prohibited/restricted/warning area/MOA/ATCAA/stationary ALTRV is provided for in a Letter of Agreement or Letter of Procedure, any clearance issued to a nonparticipating aircraft must ensure separation from these SAAs by the appropriate minima specified in paragraph 9 − 3 − 2 . b. The specialist receiving a request for a route deviation in the vicinity of an active SAA cannot issue a clearance into the active SAA airspace, unless the provisions of paragraph 9 − 3 − 4 of this handbook are applied. The FAA has no jurisdictional authority over the use of non − joint use prohibited/restricted/warning area airspace; therefore, clearance cannot be issued for flight therein without appropriate approval. c. If the specialist is able to coordinate approval for entry into the SAA from the using agency, a clearance to the aircraft complying with the provisions coordinated with the using agency can be issued; the specialist must notify the OS/CIC of this situation and of subsequent requests or deviations from other aircraft in the same area. d. Use of Code 7700 for aircraft deviations into active SAA is not encouraged, particularly in situations involving multiple aircraft. Positive identification of aircraft may be lost if an aircraft deviates from flight plan track, particularly in the event of a momentary loss of radar or other interruption in tracking. 5. RESPONSIBILITY: If a deviation occurs that causes an aircraft to enter an active prohibited/restricted/warning area/MOA/ATCAA/stationary ALTRV, the air traffic team must follow the procedures outlined below: a. Attempt the following: 1. Handoff the aircraft to the Using Agency and transfer communications; or 2. Point Out the aircraft to the Using Agency. The controller must: (a) Continue to provide safety alerts and traffic advisories, as appropriate, to the affected aircraft. (b) Continue to coordinate with the Using Agency until the situation is resolved. (c) Assist the aircraft in exiting the SAA. 3. If the handoff or point out is unsuccessful, the controller must: (a) If able, advise the Using Agency of the pilot’s actions. (b) Provide safety alerts and traffic advisories, as appropriate. (c) Assist the aircraft in exiting the SAA as quickly as the weather allows. (d) Continue to coordinate with the Using Agency until the situation is resolved. 4. If no approval to enter the SAA is given by the using agency: (a) The specialist must advise the aircraft requesting the course deviation, or deviating toward the SAA, the status of the SAA, and that no clearance can be issued permitting entry into the airspace or;"

It includes those terms which are intended for pilot/controller communications. Those terms most frequently used in pilot/controller communications are printed in bold italics . The definitions are primarily defined in an operational sense applicable to both users and operators of the National Airspace System. Use of the Glossary will preclude any misunderstandings concerning the system’s design, function, and purpose. b. Because of the international nature of flying, terms used in the Lexicon, published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), are included when they differ from FAA definitions. These terms are followed by “[ICAO].” For the reader’s convenience, there are also cross references to related terms in other parts of the Glossary and to other documents, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). c. Terms used in this glossary that apply to flight service station (FSS) roles are included when they differ from air traffic control functions. These terms are followed by “[FSS].” d. This Glossary will be revised, as necessary, to maintain a common understanding of the system. EXPLANATION OF CHANGES e.

Adapted routes are automatically applied to flight plans where appropriate. When the workload or traffic situation permits, controllers may provide radar vectors or assign requested routes to minimize circuitous routing. Adapted routes are usually confined to one ARTCC’s area and are referred to by the following names or abbreviations: a. Adapted Arrival Route (AAR). A specific arrival route from an appropriate en route point to an airport or terminal area. A Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) and/or a partial Preferred IFR Route may be included in an AAR. b. Adapted Departure Route (ADR). A specific departure route from an airport or terminal area to an en route point where there is no further need for flow control. An Instrument Departure Procedure (DP) and/or a partial Preferred IFR Route may be included in an ADR. c. Adapted Departure and Arrival Route (ADAR). A route between two terminals which are within or immediately adjacent to one ARTCC’s area. ADARs are similar to Preferred IFR Routes and may share components, but they are not synonymous.

The aircraft may proceed either via hover taxi or flight at speeds more than 20 knots. The pilot is solely responsible for selecting a safe airspeed/altitude for the operation being conducted. (See HOVER TAXI.) (Refer to AIM.) AIR TRAFFIC − Aircraft operating in the air or on an airport surface, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas. (See ICAO term AIR TRAFFIC.) AIR TRAFFIC [ICAO] − All aircraft in flight or operating on the maneuvering area of an aerodrome. AIR TRAFFIC CLEARANCE − An authorization by air traffic control for the purpose of preventing collision between known aircraft, for an aircraft to proceed under specified traffic conditions within controlled airspace. The pilot-in-command of an aircraft may not deviate from the provisions of a visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR) air traffic clearance except in an emergency or unless an amended clearance has been obtained. Additionally, the pilot may request a different clearance from that which has been issued by air traffic control (ATC) if information available to the pilot makes another course of action more practicable or if aircraft equipment limitations or company procedures forbid compliance with the clearance issued. Pilots may also request clarification or amendment, as appropriate, any time a clearance is not fully understood, or considered unacceptable because of safety of flight. Controllers should, in such instances and to the extent of operational practicality and safety, honor the pilot’s request. 14 CFR part 91.3(a) states: “The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.” THE PILOT IS RESPONSIBLE TO REQUEST AN AMENDED CLEARANCE if ATC issues a clearance that would cause a pilot to deviate from a rule or regulation, or in the pilot’s opinion, would place the aircraft in jeopardy.

Eventually, all CNFs will be labeled and begin with the letters “CF” followed by three consonants (e.g., ‘CFWBG’). CNFs are not recognized by ATC, are not contained in ATC fix or automation databases, and are not used for ATC purposes. Pilots should not use CNFs for point − to − point navigation (e.g., proceed direct), filing a flight plan, or in aircraft/ATC communications. Use of CNFs has not been adopted or recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). (REFER to AIM 1 − 1 − 17b5(i)(2), Global Positioning System (GPS).

CLASS B − Generally, that airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports in terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually tailored and consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures once an aircraft enters the airspace. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace. The cloud clearance requirement for VFR operations is “clear of clouds.” 3. CLASS C − Generally, that airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and that have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements. Although the configuration of each Class C area is individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a surface area with a 5 NM radius, a circle with a 10 NM radius that extends no lower than 1,200 feet up to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, and an outer area that is not charted.

GROUND BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (GBAS)– A ground based GNSS station which provides local differential corrections, integrity parameters and approach data via VHF data broadcast to GNSS users to meet real-time performance requirements for CAT I precision approaches. The aircraft applies the broadcast data to improve the accuracy and integrity of its GNSS signals and computes the deviations to the selected approach. A single ground station can serve multiple runway ends up to an approximate radius of 23 NM. GROUND BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (GBAS) LANDING SYSTEM (GLS)- A type of precision IAP based on local augmentation of GNSS data using a single GBAS station to transmit locally corrected GNSS data, integrity parameters and approach information. This improves the accuracy of aircraft GNSS receivers’ signal in space, enabling the pilot to fly a precision approach with much greater flexibility, reliability and complexity. The GLS procedure is published on standard IAP charts, features the title GLS with the designated runway and minima as low as 200 feet DA. Future plans are expected to support Cat II and CAT III operations. GROUND − BASED INTERVAL MANAGEMENT − SPACING (GIM − S), SPEED ADVISORY − A calculated speed that will allow aircraft to meet the TBFM schedule at en route and TRACON boundary meter fixes. GROUND CLUTTER − A pattern produced on the radar scope by ground returns which may degrade other radar returns in the affected area. The effect of ground clutter is minimized by the use of moving target indicator (MTI) circuits in the radar equipment resulting in a radar presentation which displays only targets which are in motion. (See CLUTTER.) GROUND COMMUNICATION OUTLET (GCO) − An unstaffed, remotely controlled, ground/ground communications facility. Pilots at uncontrolled airports may contact ATC and FSS via VHF radio to a telephone connection. If the connection goes to ATC, the pilot can obtain an IFR clearance or close an IFR flight plan. If the connection goes to Flight Service, the pilot can open or close a VFR flight plan; obtain an updated weather briefing prior to takeoff; close an IFR flight plan; or, for Alaska or MEDEVAC only, obtain an IFR clearance. Pilots will use four “key clicks” on the VHF radio to contact the appropriate ATC facility or six “key clicks” to contact the FSS. The GCO system is intended to be used only on the ground. GROUND CONTROLLED APPROACH − A radar approach system operated from the ground by air traffic control personnel transmitting instructions to the pilot by radio. The approach may be conducted with surveillance radar (ASR) only or with both surveillance and precision approach radar (PAR). Usage of the term “GCA” by pilots is discouraged except when referring to a GCA facility. Pilots should specifically request a “PAR” approach when a precision radar approach is desired or request an “ASR” or “surveillance” approach when a nonprecision radar approach is desired. (See"

Rime Ice − Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by the instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets. b. Clear Ice − A glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively slow freezing of large supercooled water droplets. c. Mixed − A mixture of clear ice and rime ice. Intensity of icing: a. Trace − Ice becomes noticeable. The rate of accumulation is slightly greater than the rate of sublimation. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is less than ¼ inch (6 mm) per hour on the outer wing. The pilot should consider exiting the icing conditions before they become worse. b. Light − The rate of ice accumulation requires occasional cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is ¼ inch to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing. The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition. c. Moderate − The rate of ice accumulation requires frequent cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe.

PRECISION APPROACH RADAR − Radar equipment in some ATC facilities operated by the FAA and/or the military services at joint-use civil/military locations and separate military installations to detect and display azimuth, elevation, and range of aircraft on the final approach course to a runway. This equipment may be used to monitor certain nonradar approaches, but is primarily used to conduct a precision instrument approach (PAR) wherein the controller issues guidance instructions to the pilot based on the aircraft’s position in relation to the final approach course (azimuth), the glidepath (elevation), and the distance (range) from the touchdown point on the runway as displayed on the radar scope. (See GLIDEPATH.) (See PAR.) (See ICAO term PRECISION APPROACH RADAR.) (Refer to AIM.)

PRECISION RUNWAY MONITOR (PRM) SYSTEM − Provides air traffic controllers monitoring the NTZ during simultaneous close parallel PRM approaches with precision, high update rate secondary surveillance data. The high update rate surveillance sensor component of the PRM system is only required for specific runway or approach course separation. The high resolution color monitoring display, Final Monitor Aid (FMA) of the PRM system, or other FMA with the same capability, presents NTZ surveillance track data to controllers along with detailed maps depicting approaches and no transgression zone and is required for all simultaneous close parallel PRM NTZ monitoring operations. (Refer to AIM.) PREDICTIVE WIND SHEAR ALERT SYSTEM (PWS) − A self − contained system used on board some aircraft to alert the flight crew to the presence of a potential wind shear. PWS systems typically monitor 3 miles ahead and 25 degrees left and right of the aircraft’s heading at or below 1200’ AGL. Departing flights may receive a wind shear alert after they start the takeoff roll and may elect to abort the takeoff. Aircraft on approach receiving an alert may elect to go around or perform a wind shear escape maneuver. PREFERRED IFR ROUTES − Routes established between busier airports to increase system efficiency and capacity. They normally extend through one or more ARTCC areas and are designed to achieve balanced traffic flows among high density terminals. IFR clearances are issued on the basis of these routes except when severe weather avoidance procedures or other factors dictate otherwise. Preferred IFR Routes are listed in the Chart Supplement U.S., and are also available at https://www.fly.faa.gov/rmt/nfdc_preferred_routes_database.jsp . If a flight is planned to or from an area having such routes but the departure or arrival point is not listed in the Chart Supplement U.S., pilots may use that part of a Preferred IFR Route which is appropriate for the departure or arrival point that is listed. Preferred IFR Routes may be defined by DPs, SIDs, or STARs; NAVAIDs, Waypoints, etc.; high or low altitude airways; or any combinations thereof. Because they often share elements with adapted routes, pilots’ use of preferred IFR routes can minimize flight plan route amendments. (See ADAPTED ROUTES.) (See CENTER’S AREA.)

The scheduled times allow for merging of traffic flows, efficiently utilizing airport and airspace capacity while minimizing coordination and reducing the need for vectoring/holding. The TBFM schedule is calculated using current aircraft estimated time of arrival at key defined constraint points based on wind forecasts, aircraft flight plan, the desired separation at the constraint point and other parameters. The schedule applies spacing only when needed to maintain the desired separation at one or more constraint points. This includes, but is not limited to, Single Center Metering (SCM), Adjacent Center Metering (ACM), En Route Departure Capability (EDC), Integrated Departure/Arrival Capability (IDAC), Ground − based Interval Management − Spacing (GIM − S), Departure Scheduling, and Extended/Coupled Metering. TIME − BASED MANAGEMENT (TBM) − A methodology for managing the flow of air traffic through the assignment of time at specific points for an aircraft. TBM applies time to manage and condition air traffic flows to mitigate demand/capacity imbalances and enhance efficiency and predictability of the NAS. Where implemented, TBM tools will be used to manage traffic even during periods when demand does not exceed capacity. This will sustain operational predictability and assure the regional/national strategic plan is maintained. TBM uses capabilities within TFMS, TBFM, and TFDM. These programs are"

Rollout RVR − The RVR readout values obtained from RVR equipment located nearest the rollout end of the runway. (See ICAO term FLIGHT VISIBILITY.) (See ICAO term GROUND VISIBILITY.) (See ICAO term RUNWAY VISUAL RANGE.) (See ICAO term VISIBILITY.) VISIBILITY [ICAO] − The ability, as determined by atmospheric conditions and expressed in units of distance, to see and identify prominent unlighted objects by day and prominent lighted objects by night. a. Flight Visibility − The visibility forward from the cockpit of an aircraft in flight. b. Ground Visibility − The visibility at an aerodrome as reported by an accredited observer. c. Runway Visual Range [RVR] − The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centerline of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centerline. VISUAL APPROACH − An approach conducted on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan which authorizes the pilot to proceed visually and clear of clouds to the airport. The pilot must, at all times, have either the airport or the preceding aircraft in sight. This approach must be authorized and under the control of the appropriate air traffic control facility. Reported weather at the airport must be: ceiling at or above 1,000 feet, and visibility of 3 miles or greater. (See ICAO term VISUAL APPROACH.)

As an airfoil moves through the atmosphere in sustained flight, an area of area of low pressure is created above it. The air flowing from the high pressure area to the low pressure area around and about the tips of the airfoil tends to roll up into two rapidly rotating vortices, cylindrical in shape. These vortices are the most predominant parts of aircraft wake turbulence and their rotational force is dependent upon the wing loading, gross weight, and speed of the generating aircraft. The vortices from medium to super aircraft can be of extremely high velocity and hazardous to smaller aircraft. (See AIRCRAFT CLASSES.) (See WAKE TURBULENCE.) (Refer to AIM.)

BACKGROUND: In 2017, the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) began testing Offshore Precipitation Capability (OPC) at facilities with little or no weather radar coverage in offshore/oceanic airspace. Air traffic personnel use OPC’s web-based weather information in facilities to assist in planning and decision-making. OPC is a non-certified prototype weather detection and display system that generates real-time graphic weather products for offshore/oceanic airspace. OPC ingests lightning data, National Weather Service (NWS) numerical models, satellite imagery, and other atmospheric data to produce graphic weather displays similar to those currently available on the Corridor Integrated Weather System and Traffic Situation Display. OPC precipitation intensity displayed is not derived from the NWS radar equipment or National Airspace System ground-based digitized radar equipment with weather capabilities; therefore, precipitation intensities must not be issued.
