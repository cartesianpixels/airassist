"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-1","This order, FAA Order 7110.65, provides the procedures and phraseology for air traffic control services. All controllers must be familiar with these provisions and use their best judgment in situations not explicitly covered. The primary purpose of the ATC system is to prevent collisions between aircraft and to organize and expedite the flow of air traffic."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-2","The primary duty of an air traffic controller is to separate aircraft and issue safety alerts. Secondary responsibilities include providing support to national security and homeland defense activities. Additional services are to be provided to the extent possible, but these duties do not take priority over safety-related functions. Controllers must use good judgment in prioritizing their tasks based on the operational situation."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-4","The word 'immediately' should only be used when compliance is required to avoid an imminent situation. The word 'expedite' is used when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an imminent situation. When using 'expedite,' the controller must also state the reason for the instruction. For example, 'Expedite your descent, traffic at your 12 o'clock.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-6","A safety alert must be issued if a controller observes an aircraft in a position that, in their judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft. The alert should identify the threat, for example, 'Low Altitude Alert, check your altitude immediately' or 'Traffic Alert, (call sign), traffic 12 o'clock, 5 miles, opposite direction.' The controller's responsibility for the alert ends when the pilot reports taking corrective action."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-8","When a pilot declares 'minimum fuel,' the controller must inform any subsequent control facility of this status. This is not an emergency, but it indicates that the aircraft cannot accept any undue delay. [20, 29] While it does not grant automatic priority, controllers should be alert for any situation that might delay the aircraft. If the pilot requires priority, they must declare an emergency and state fuel remaining in minutes. [20, 29]"
"FAAO 7110.65 2-4-2","Radio frequencies are for specific purposes and must be monitored continuously. Transmissions should be limited to those necessary for air traffic control and air safety. Brevity is important, but not at the expense of clarity. Standard phraseology is crucial for understanding. [23, 30]"
"FAAO 7110.65 2-4-20","Use an aircraft's full call sign on initial contact. After communication is established, the call sign may be abbreviated to the prefix and the last three digits/letters of the registration (e.g., N12345 becomes N345). Do not abbreviate air carrier call signs or any call signs that are similar to others on the frequency to prevent confusion. [26]"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-1","The Clearance Delivery position is responsible for issuing departure clearances and ensuring pilots read them back correctly. This includes the cleared route, altitude, and any applicable departure procedures. When traffic management initiatives are in effect, Clearance Delivery must issue 'hold for release' instructions."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-4","A departure clearance must be issued and read back verbatim. The clearance must contain the clearance limit (usually the destination airport), a specified route, an initial altitude, and departure instructions, including the departure control frequency and transponder code. This is often remembered by the acronym CRAFT."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-1","Ground Control is responsible for the movement of aircraft and vehicles on the airport's movement areas, which includes all taxiways and inactive runways. Instructions must be clear and provide a specific route. For example: 'N12345, taxi to runway 27 via taxiway Alpha, hold short of runway 27.' A readback of all runway hold short instructions is mandatory."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-5-3","When issuing taxi instructions, provide concise and easy-to-understand directions. Use standard taxiway and runway nomenclature. Avoid using ambiguous terms. If there is a possibility of confusion, provide additional information to clarify the intended route. Always obtain a readback of hold short instructions."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-7-1","The Local Controller (Tower) is responsible for operations on the active runway(s). Before clearing an aircraft for takeoff, the controller must visually confirm that the runway is clear of all traffic, vehicles, or obstructions. The correct phraseology is 'Runway [number], Cleared for Takeoff.' [5]"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-8-1","The local controller is responsible for separating aircraft on and in the vicinity of the airport. This includes issuing takeoff and landing clearances, sequencing arriving and departing aircraft, and providing traffic advisories. The local controller must maintain a continuous watch on all flight operations."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-9-4","The instruction 'Line Up and Wait' (LUAW) directs a pilot to taxi onto the specified runway and hold in takeoff position. It is not a takeoff clearance. This instruction should not be used unless the departure is imminent. The controller must state the runway, for example, 'N12345, Runway 27, Line Up and Wait.' [5]"
"FAAO 7110.65 4-2-1","An IFR clearance is required for flight in controlled airspace under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The clearance provides a specific route, altitude, and clearance limit. Controllers must issue these clearances in a specific order: Clearance limit, Route of flight, Altitude, Frequency, and Transponder code (CRAFT)."
"FAAO 7110.65 4-3-2","An IFR departure clearance authorizes an aircraft to proceed under instrument flight rules. The clearance will specify a heading or route to fly after takeoff, an initial altitude, and a frequency to contact after departure. The pilot must read back the clearance to the controller."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-10","Controllers may approve a pilot's request to deviate from their assigned route or altitude for weather avoidance. When this occurs, the controller must ensure that separation is maintained from other aircraft. The controller should provide vectors or other instructions to help the pilot navigate around the weather."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-1","Radar separation is the primary method used to separate aircraft in most airspace. The standard minimum is 5 nautical miles in the en route environment and 3 nautical miles within 40 miles of the radar antenna in the terminal environment. These minima can be increased for various reasons, including for wake turbulence separation between certain aircraft types. [14]"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-4","Vertical separation is achieved by assigning different altitudes. The standard is 1,000 feet of separation for aircraft up to and including Flight Level (FL) 410. Above FL410, 2,000 feet is required unless the aircraft are operating in Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) airspace, where 1,000 feet is authorized up to FL410."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-6-1","Vectoring is the use of radar-assigned headings to guide an aircraft. Controllers issue vectors for separation, sequencing, noise abatement, or to navigate around weather or airspace. The phraseology is 'Fly heading [degrees],' and the controller should state the purpose of the vector, such as 'Vector for sequence.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-1","When vectoring an aircraft for an instrument approach, the intercept angle to the final approach course should be no more than 30 degrees. The aircraft should be vectored to join the final approach course at least two miles from the Final Approach Fix (FAF) to allow the pilot to become established on the approach. [45]"
"FAAO 7110.65 7-2-1","Visual separation may be applied by a controller or by a pilot. If tower-applied, the controller must visually see the aircraft and maintain communication with at least one of them. If pilot-applied, the controller must get confirmation from the pilot that they have the other aircraft in sight and will maintain separation. The controller must issue traffic information and an instruction to maintain visual separation. [36, 43, 48]"
"FAAO 7110.65 7-4-1","A visual approach may be authorized when the reported weather is a ceiling of at least 1,000 feet and visibility of 3 miles or greater. The pilot must have either the airport or the preceding aircraft in sight. If following another aircraft, the pilot is responsible for maintaining a safe approach interval and wake turbulence separation. [12, 15]"
"FAAO 7110.65 7-4-4","Special VFR (SVFR) operations may be authorized within the surface area of a controlled airport when weather is below VFR minimums. The pilot must request SVFR, and flight visibility must be at least 1 statute mile. The aircraft must remain clear of clouds. SVFR is only authorized if traffic permits and is not available at all airports. [1, 2, 3, 8]"
"FAAO 7110.65 10-1-1","An emergency can be declared by the pilot, ATC, or other agencies. An aircraft in distress has the right-of-way over all other traffic. The controller must provide maximum assistance, which includes obtaining all necessary information about the emergency and coordinating with other facilities and emergency response services."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-4","In the event of a two-way radio communication failure, the controller should attempt to re-establish contact on other available frequencies, including the guard frequency (121.5 MHz). The controller should use all available means, including radar and other aircraft, to determine the pilot's intentions and should assume the pilot will follow standard lost communication procedures."
"AIM 2-3-5","Runway Holding Position Markings consist of four yellow lines, two solid and two dashed. Aircraft must stop before crossing the solid lines when instructed to 'hold short' of a runway. Crossing these markings without an ATC clearance is a runway incursion. An aircraft is not considered clear of the runway until all parts of the aircraft have crossed these markings. [6, 16, 22, 27, 41]"
"AIM 4-1-9","Initial radio contact with an ATC facility should follow the 'Four Ws': Who you are calling, Who you are (full call sign), Where you are, and What you want (request). For example: 'Miami Center, N12345, 20 miles east of the Dolphin VOR, at one zero thousand, request.' This provides the controller with all necessary information in the initial transmission. [23, 34]"
"AIM 4-2-1","Pilots are primarily responsible for wake turbulence avoidance. Wake turbulence is generated by all aircraft but is most severe behind heavy, clean (flaps and gear retracted), and slow aircraft. Controllers apply mandatory separation standards, but pilots should always be aware of the potential hazard, especially during takeoff and landing phases. [17, 25, 28, 39]"
"AIM 4-2-3","Pilots must read back all altitude assignments. When cleared to 'climb and maintain' or 'descend and maintain' an altitude, the pilot is expected to initiate the maneuver promptly. It is good practice for the pilot to report leaving their previously assigned altitude to keep the controller informed."
"AIM 4-3-14","Pilots must have an airport diagram available for taxiing. If at any point the taxi instructions are unclear, the pilot must stop and ask for clarification from ground control. This is a critical procedure to prevent runway incursions."
"AIM 5-4-21","A visual approach is an IFR procedure conducted in VMC. The pilot must have the airport or preceding aircraft in sight, and reported weather must be at least a 1000-foot ceiling and 3 miles visibility. ATC can initiate a visual approach, and it helps to expedite the flow of traffic. [12, 15]"
"AIM 5-4-23","A contact approach must be requested by the pilot; it cannot be initiated by ATC. It requires at least 1-mile flight visibility and the pilot must remain clear of clouds, navigating by visual reference to the ground. The pilot is responsible for obstruction clearance. This approach is riskier and should only be used when the pilot is familiar with the local terrain. [4, 7, 9, 10]"
"AIM 6-1-1","The Pilot in Command (PIC) is the final authority for the operation of the aircraft. In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the PIC may deviate from any rule to the extent necessary to meet that emergency. The pilot must notify ATC of the deviation as soon as possible."
"AIM 6-2-4","If a pilot experiences a two-way radio failure, they should set their transponder to code 7600. Under IFR, the pilot should follow a specific route priority: Assigned, Vectored, Expected, Filed (AVE-F). For altitude, they should fly the highest of: Assigned, Minimum IFR altitude, or Expected (MEA)."
"IVAO US-DIV SOP 1.1","All IVAO members are expected to conduct themselves professionally and realistically. While based on real-world documents like the 7110.65, IVAO procedures may be modified by local SOPs or Letters of Agreement (LOAs) to suit the virtual environment. All participants should be familiar with both real-world and IVAO-specific rules."
"IVAO SOP 2.2.1","Respect and professionalism are mandatory on the IVAO network. Harassment, offensive language, or any form of discrimination is strictly prohibited and can lead to suspension or removal from the network. The goal is to maintain a friendly and educational environment for all members."
"IVAO SOP 4.2.2","Controllers on IVAO must only connect to positions for which they hold the appropriate ATC rating. For example, a controller with an ADC (Approach/Departure Controller) rating can control Tower and Ground, but not a Center (ACC) position. This ensures controllers have the demonstrated knowledge for the complexity of the airspace they are managing."
"IVAO SOP 4.4.1","A handoff is the transfer of control of an aircraft from one controller to another. The transferring controller must ensure the receiving controller has accepted the handoff before instructing the pilot to change frequency. All pertinent information, including any assigned restrictions, must be coordinated. [18, 24, 34, 37, 42]"
"Local SOP ZAB_CTR 3.1","Albuquerque Center (ZAB) has complex airspace with numerous high-altitude sectors. Coordination between sectors is critical, especially for aircraft transitioning through military operating areas (MOAs). Controllers must verify MOA status (hot or cold) and coordinate any crossings with the appropriate military liaison or adjacent sector."
"Phraseology and Communication","Clarity and brevity are key. Use standard ICAO/FAA phraseology. For example, state numbers individually: 'one three three point niner' for 133.9. Acknowledge instructions with your call sign and the instruction, not just 'roger.' 'Roger' means you received the transmission, but it does not confirm you understood or will comply. [5, 23, 30, 31]"
"Airport Operations","The Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) is a continuous broadcast of essential airport information, including weather, active runways, and pertinent NOTAMs. Each broadcast is assigned a phonetic letter (Alpha, Bravo, etc.). Pilots must inform the controller on initial contact that they have received the current ATIS information. [13, 19, 21, 32, 35]"
"Approach/Departure Control","Approach and Departure control services are provided by a TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control). [40, 47, 49, 50] Approach controllers sequence arriving aircraft for landing, issuing vectors and altitude assignments to guide them to the final approach course. Departure controllers guide departing aircraft out of the terminal area and integrate them into the en-route structure, ensuring separation from other traffic. [40, 47, 49, 50]"
"Emergency Procedures","The three main emergency transponder codes are 7700 for a general emergency, 7600 for a lost communication, and 7500 for unlawful interference (hijacking). When a controller observes one of these codes, they must immediately take action to ascertain the status of the flight and provide assistance."
"Weather and NOTAM procedures","Controllers must advise pilots of hazardous weather that may impact operations within 150 NM of their sector. This includes SIGMETs, Convective SIGMETs, AIRMETs, and urgent PIREPs. Phraseology should be 'Attention all aircraft, hazardous weather information (type) for (area) is available on HIWAS, Flight Watch, or Flight Service frequencies.'"
"Coordination procedures","A handoff is the process of transferring radar identification, communications, and control of an aircraft to the next controller. The transferring controller initiates a 'flash' on the receiving controller's scope. The receiving controller must accept the handoff before the transferring controller instructs the pilot to change frequency. This ensures there is no loss of control. [18, 24, 34, 37, 42]"
"Training standards and evaluation criteria","IVAO controller training is structured around a rating system, from Student (S1/S2) to Controller (C1) and Senior Controller (C3). Each rating requires passing both a theoretical and a practical exam. Evaluators assess candidates on their knowledge of regulations, phraseology, efficiency, and their ability to manage traffic safely under various workload scenarios."
"Common Trainee Mistake","A common mistake for new Ground Controllers is forgetting to obtain a readback for hold short instructions. This is a critical safety item. If a pilot fails to read back a hold short instruction, the controller MUST restate it and ask for a readback to ensure the instruction was understood and will be complied with."
"Common Trainee Mistake","New Tower controllers sometimes clear an aircraft for takeoff before a preceding landing aircraft is clear of the runway. Per 7110.65 3-9-6, a departing aircraft cannot be cleared for takeoff until the arriving aircraft has landed and taxied off the runway or has passed the runway end if it is a low approach or touch-and-go."
"Advanced Procedure: LAHSO","Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO) are procedures where an aircraft is cleared to land and hold short of an intersecting runway, taxiway, or other designated point. This requires specific phraseology and the pilot must accept the LAHSO clearance. For example: 'N12345, Runway 27, Cleared to land, hold short of Runway 33.' The pilot must read back the full clearance."
"Advanced Procedure: Point Out","A 'point out' is a procedure where a controller electronically identifies an aircraft to another controller's scope for coordination purposes, but control is not transferred. This is used when an aircraft will enter another controller's airspace but will not require their control, for example, an aircraft skirting the edge of a sector. The receiving controller must approve the point out."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-1","When an aircraft reports an engine failure, the controller must ask the pilot for their intentions. Provide vectors to the nearest suitable airport, considering runway length, weather, and terrain. Clear the airspace for the emergency aircraft and provide all possible assistance, including information on airport conditions and emergency services availability. Phraseology: 'N12345, what are your intentions?'"
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-6","For a pressurization loss or other situation requiring an emergency descent, the controller must immediately clear the airspace below the aircraft. Broadcast an alert on all relevant frequencies to warn other traffic. The clearance should be open-ended: 'N12345, emergency descent approved. Descend to and maintain the lowest available altitude. Advise passing through altitudes.' Coordinate with all affected sectors."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-1-5","A pilot declaration of 'MINIMUM FUEL' is not an emergency, but indicates an emergency is possible should any undue delay occur. A declaration of 'MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY, FUEL EMERGENCY' is a formal emergency. The aircraft is given priority, and the controller must ask for fuel remaining in minutes. This information is critical for determining how long the aircraft can remain airborne."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-3","Aircraft engaged in a medical emergency (MEDEVAC) are given priority handling. This includes air ambulances or any flight using the call sign 'MEDEVAC' or 'HOSP'. Controllers should provide the most expeditious routing and handling possible to facilitate the mission. This may involve vectoring other traffic or clearing runways to ensure an unimpeded arrival."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-5","When a controller receives information that an aircraft is being hijacked (transponder code 7500 or voice report), they must immediately notify their supervisor and follow facility directives. The controller's primary responsibility is to handle the aircraft as directed and to maintain separation from all other traffic. Do not issue any instructions that could aggravate the situation. Maintain radio silence unless the pilot initiates communication."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-3-1","Search and Rescue (SAR) procedures are initiated when an aircraft is considered overdue. The controller must gather all available information, including the last known position, flight plan route, fuel status, and persons on board (POB). This information is relayed to the appropriate Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) to initiate SAR operations."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-4-4","For an emergency landing, such as a gear-up landing, the controller must alert the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) services with the aircraft's location, type, fuel status, and nature of the emergency. The controller should clear the designated emergency runway and all intersecting runways, and provide the pilot with any requested information, such as wind and runway conditions."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-11-1","The local controller must coordinate with the ARFF commander during an emergency. The controller provides information on wind, runway conditions, and other air traffic. The ARFF commander advises the controller on the readiness of the emergency equipment and when the runway is clear to be used again. The controller has the final authority on opening or closing the runway."
"AIM 6-4-1","For a lost communication (NORDO) aircraft under IFR in VMC, the pilot is expected to continue the flight under VFR and land as soon as practicable. The controller should monitor the aircraft's track and clear traffic, anticipating a VFR approach and landing at a suitable airport."
"AIM 6-4-1","For a lost communication (NORDO) aircraft under IFR in IMC, the pilot will follow a specific route priority: 1. Assigned (the route assigned in the last ATC clearance), 2. Vectored (if being vectored, fly direct to the fix, route, or airway specified in the vector clearance), 3. Expected (the route ATC has advised to expect), 4. Filed (the route as filed in the flight plan). This is remembered by the acronym AVEF."
"AIM 6-4-1","For a lost communication (NORDO) aircraft under IFR in IMC, the pilot will fly a specific altitude priority, which is the HIGHEST of the following: 1. Minimum altitude for IFR operations (MEA), 2. Expected altitude (the altitude ATC has advised to expect), 3. Assigned altitude (the altitude assigned in the last ATC clearance). This is remembered by the acronym MEA."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-4","If a NORDO aircraft is in radar contact and squawking 7600, the controller can attempt to communicate through other means. This includes asking the pilot to make turns to acknowledge instructions or to squawk IDENT. For example: 'N12345, if you can hear me, squawk IDENT.' This can be used to confirm the pilot is receiving transmissions and to issue basic clearances."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-3","When an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) signal is heard or reported, the controller must notify the supervisor and provide the ARTCC with the signal's location, strength, and time of first and last reception. The controller should also attempt to solicit assistance from other aircraft in the area to pinpoint the ELT's location."
"AIM 7-5-12","When a pilot reports a bird strike, the controller should ask for the location of the strike and if the aircraft is in any difficulty. The controller must then notify airport operations to have the runway inspected. A general warning should be issued to other aircraft operating in the area about the bird activity."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-1","If a pilot reports a hydraulic failure, the controller should anticipate that the aircraft may have difficulty maneuvering and may require a longer runway for landing. The controller should ask the pilot for their specific needs, provide vectors that allow for wide turns, and coordinate with ARFF for a standby response upon landing."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-13","Military aircraft often fly in formation. A standard formation is considered a single aircraft for separation purposes, with the lead pilot responsible for the separation within the formation. For non-standard formations (more than 1 mile wide or long), the controller must apply separation to the perimeter of the entire formation."
"FAAO 7110.65 4-3-4","Presidential Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) are highly restrictive. No unauthorized aircraft may enter the TFR. Controllers must be aware of the TFR's dimensions and times. Any aircraft entering the TFR without authorization must be reported immediately to security services. The controller's role is to vector authorized traffic around the TFR and handle any potential intruders."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-20","Special Use Airspace (SUA), such as a Military Operations Area (MOA) or Restricted Area, requires coordination. Before clearing an aircraft through an active MOA, the controller must coordinate with the using agency. For Restricted Areas, no aircraft may enter when active without permission from the controlling agency. Controllers must vector traffic around active restricted airspace."
"AIM 4-3-24","Noise abatement procedures are established to reduce aircraft noise over populated areas. These can include preferential runway use, specific departure paths, or restrictions on engine run-ups. Controllers must be familiar with their facility's noise abatement procedures and issue instructions that comply with them, unless a pilot requests a different procedure for safety reasons."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-10-4","Simultaneous operations on intersecting runways are permitted if specific criteria are met. The controller must ensure that the flight paths of the two aircraft do not intersect and that separation is maintained. For example, a landing aircraft must have crossed the intersection before a departing aircraft begins its takeoff roll from the other runway. This requires precise timing and judgment."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-5","Category II/III ILS operations require a protected ILS critical area when the weather is below 800 feet ceiling or 2 miles visibility. This means no aircraft or vehicle can be in the critical area while an aircraft is inside the final approach fix. Separation between successive ILS approaches is also increased to ensure signal integrity."
"AIM 7-3-6","Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) allows for 1,000 feet of vertical separation between aircraft from FL290 to FL410. Both the aircraft and the pilot must be RVSM-certified. If a pilot reports 'negative RVSM,' the controller must provide 2,000 feet of vertical separation from all other aircraft. Phraseology: 'Confirm RVSM approved.'"
"AIM 4-4-11","When a pilot reports a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA), such as 'TCAS Climb,' the controller must not issue any instructions that conflict with the RA. The pilot is expected to follow the RA. The controller's responsibility for separation is suspended for that specific conflict but resumes once the pilot reports 'Clear of conflict.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-13","For non-standard formation flights, where aircraft are more than 1 mile apart, the controller must apply separation to the leading and trailing edges of the formation. The pilot of the lead aircraft is still responsible for separation within the formation, but ATC is responsible for separating the entire formation from other traffic."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-14","Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operations require coordination. If a UAS experiences a 'lost link' event, it may behave unpredictably. The controller should be aware of the UAS's lost link procedures and clear other traffic from the area. The controller's primary role is to ensure the safety of manned aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-4-1","Airshows and other special events often require a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR). The controlling facility is responsible for disseminating the TFR information and ensuring no unauthorized aircraft enter the restricted airspace. Coordination with the event organizers is essential for managing the scheduled aerial activities."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-3","For parachute jump operations, the controller must be aware of the jump aircraft's location and the intended jump zone. The controller should issue traffic advisories to both the jump aircraft and other aircraft in the vicinity. Phraseology: 'Attention all aircraft, parachute jumping in the vicinity of [location] from [altitude].'"
"AIM 4-5-4","Glider operations often occur near airports and can involve winch or aerotow launches. Controllers should be aware of local glider activity and provide traffic advisories. Gliders have the right-of-way over powered aircraft, and pilots of powered aircraft should be extra vigilant in areas of known glider operations."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-3","Flight Check aircraft are used to calibrate navigational aids and have priority over all other traffic except aircraft in distress. These aircraft often fly non-standard routes and altitudes. Controllers must coordinate their movements and provide separation from other traffic while accommodating their mission requirements."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-4 Note 4","Wake Turbulence Recategorization (RECAT) is an advanced separation standard used at some busy airports. It replaces the traditional weight-based wake categories with a more detailed system based on wingspan and approach speed. This allows for reduced separation in some cases, increasing airport capacity. Controllers must be specifically trained on RECAT procedures."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-17","If an aircraft reports a bomb threat, the controller must advise the pilot of the most suitable airport for landing, considering isolation and security. The controller should ask if the pilot intends to evacuate the aircraft on the runway. All information must be relayed to the supervisor and security authorities. The controller should handle the aircraft as an emergency."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-14","If a pilot requests technical assistance, the controller is not expected to provide it. However, the controller can act as a communication link to the airline's maintenance or dispatch center. The controller can relay information and instructions between the pilot and the technical experts."
"AIM 6-4-3","Light gun signals are used to communicate with aircraft that have lost radio communication. From the tower, a steady green light means 'Cleared for takeoff' (on ground) or 'Cleared to land' (in air). A flashing red light means 'Taxi clear of runway' (on ground) or 'Airport unsafe, do not land' (in air). A steady red means 'Stop!' (on ground) or 'Give way to other aircraft and continue circling' (in air)."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-2-17","If a pilot reports a TCAS RA, they are authorized to deviate from their assigned clearance to follow the RA. The controller should not attempt to modify the flight path of the aircraft involved in the RA. After the conflict is resolved, the pilot will report 'Clear of conflict,' and the controller will resume providing separation and issue a new clearance as needed."
"IVAO US-DIV SOP 6.1","On the IVAO network, simulating an emergency is permitted but must be done realistically and with prior coordination if possible. A pilot intending to simulate an emergency should include 'EMERG' in their flight plan remarks. Controllers should handle simulated emergencies with the same priority and procedures as a real one to provide a valuable training experience for all."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-13","Military aircraft on an IFR Military Training Route (IR) are flown under IFR and are provided separation by ATC. Aircraft on a VFR Military Training Route (VR) are flown under VFR and are responsible for their own separation. Controllers should provide traffic advisories to VFR aircraft in the vicinity of VR routes."
"FAAO 7110.65 4-3-4","A VIP TFR is established to protect persons like the President or Vice President. These TFRs are typically 'no-fly' zones with very limited exceptions. The controller's job is to ensure the TFR is not violated by vectoring all non-participating aircraft around it. Any aircraft that enters the TFR is considered a potential threat and is handled by security agencies."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-20","When a MOA (Military Operations Area) is active or 'hot,' VFR aircraft can fly through but should exercise extreme caution. IFR aircraft will be separated from the MOA activity by ATC. The controller must coordinate with the using agency to determine the status of the MOA and what altitudes are affected."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-10-4","When conducting simultaneous operations on intersecting runways, the controller must ensure that separation standards are met. For example, a takeoff clearance cannot be issued to an aircraft on one runway until the landing aircraft on the intersecting runway has passed the intersection. This requires precise timing and a clear view of the intersection."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-5","During CAT II/III ILS operations, the ILS critical area must be protected to prevent signal interference. This means no aircraft or vehicle can enter the area between the outer marker and the runway. Controllers must issue explicit hold short instructions for the ILS critical area, which is different from the normal runway hold short line."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-3","A flight with the call sign 'Flight Check' has priority over all other traffic except an aircraft in distress. This is because they are performing a critical mission to certify the accuracy of navigational aids. Controllers must accommodate their requested routes and altitudes, which are often non-standard, and provide separation from other aircraft."
"AIM 4-4-11","A pilot's response to a TCAS RA takes precedence over any ATC instruction. If a pilot reports 'TCAS climb,' and the controller had just issued a descent clearance, the pilot will climb. The controller must not issue any further instructions until the pilot reports 'Clear of conflict.' The controller's primary role becomes monitoring the situation and ensuring other traffic is not affected."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-1","If an aircraft experiences an engine failure after takeoff, the tower controller must maintain visual contact with the aircraft as long as possible and coordinate with the departure controller. The controller should ask for the pilot's intentions and be prepared for a potential return to the airport or an off-airport landing. All other traffic should be cleared from the area."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-6","An emergency descent requires immediate action from the controller. The phraseology 'Emergency descent approved' gives the pilot blanket clearance to descend. The controller must immediately broadcast a warning on all frequencies for the affected airspace, for example: 'Attention all aircraft in the vicinity of the ABC VOR, emergency descent in progress from Flight Level 350.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 10-1-5","When a pilot declares a fuel emergency, the controller must ask for the fuel remaining in minutes. This information is vital for planning and must be relayed to the receiving controller if the aircraft is handed off. The controller should provide the most direct routing to the airport and prepare for an expedited landing."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-5","If a hijacking is suspected, the controller should try to confirm by asking the pilot to squawk 7500 or to make a specific transmission if able. For example: 'N12345, if you are experiencing unlawful interference, squawk seven five zero zero.' The controller should avoid using the word 'hijack' on the frequency unless first used by the pilot."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-3-2","When an aircraft is considered overdue, the controller must check the flight plan for the proposed route and destination. They should also check with adjacent facilities and any airports along the route of flight to see if the aircraft has landed. This information is critical for narrowing the search area for SAR operations."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-4-4","When an aircraft is making an emergency landing, the controller should ask the pilot if they want the emergency equipment to be standing by. The phraseology is 'Do you want the emergency equipment standing by?' The controller then relays the pilot's request to the ARFF services. This ensures a coordinated response on the ground."
"AIM 6-4-3","An alternating red and green light gun signal means 'Exercise extreme caution.' This signal is used when there is a specific hazard, such as another aircraft in close proximity or an obstruction on the runway. It is a general warning signal that requires the pilot to be extra vigilant."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-13","When a military formation flight requests to split, the controller must issue separate clearances and transponder codes to each aircraft or element of the formation. The controller must ensure that standard separation is applied between the individual aircraft after the split is complete."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-4-1","A TFR for a special event like a major sporting event is established to provide a safe environment. These TFRs typically have a 3 nautical mile radius and extend up to 3,000 feet AGL. The controller must be aware of the TFR's dimensions and times and vector non-participating VFR aircraft around it."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-20","If a pilot requests to fly through an active MOA, the controller must advise the pilot that the MOA is active and that they will be responsible for their own separation from the military traffic. The controller should provide any known traffic advisories but cannot provide IFR separation from the MOA activity."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-10-4","A key requirement for simultaneous intersecting runway operations is that the runways must be dry. These operations are prohibited when the runways are wet or contaminated, as this can affect braking action and increase the risk of an aircraft overshooting the intersection."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-5","When CAT II/III ILS operations are in effect, the controller must use specific phraseology to inform pilots. This is typically done via the ATIS broadcast, for example: 'Low visibility procedures are in effect. ILS critical areas are not protected for aircraft over 10,000 pounds.' This alerts pilots to the more stringent requirements."
"AIM 7-3-6","A pilot of a non-RVSM aircraft who needs to fly in RVSM airspace for a specific reason (e.g., maintenance flight) must request an exception from ATC. The controller will coordinate this request and, if approved, must provide 2,000 feet of vertical separation between the non-RVSM aircraft and all other traffic."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-2-17","After a TCAS RA is resolved and the pilot reports 'Clear of conflict,' the controller must verify the aircraft's altitude and issue a new clearance to return it to its previously assigned altitude or a new altitude as required. Phraseology: 'N12345, roger, return to and maintain one zero thousand.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-1","If a pilot reports an engine fire, the controller should be prepared for an immediate emergency descent and landing. The controller should ask if the pilot has discharged the fire extinguishing agent. This information is important for the ARFF services. The controller should provide all possible assistance and clear traffic from the aircraft's path."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-14","If a pilot reports a medical emergency on board, the controller should ask for the nature of the medical problem and if a doctor is on board. The controller should also ask if the pilot wants to declare an emergency and land at the nearest suitable airport. This information helps coordinate with medical services on the ground."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-3-1","If an aircraft is overdue, the controller must issue an ALNOT (Alert Notice) within a specified time frame. The ALNOT is sent to all ARTCCs and facilities along the aircraft's route of flight. This notice officially begins the SAR process and alerts all facilities to be on the lookout for the missing aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-11-1","During an emergency, the tower controller acts as the communication link between the incident commander on the ground and the air traffic system. The controller can relay requests for additional equipment or personnel and provide updates on the status of the airfield to other aircraft and facilities."
"AIM 6-4-1","If a pilot loses communication while being vectored for an approach, they are expected to fly direct to the fix specified in the vector clearance. Once at the fix, they should fly the published instrument approach procedure. The controller should anticipate this and keep the approach course clear of other traffic."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-13","Aerial refueling operations are conducted in specific tracks or anchors. These are treated as moving SUAs. The controller must ensure that non-participating aircraft are separated from the tanker and receiver aircraft by the prescribed vertical or lateral separation minima. This requires close coordination with the military."
"FAAO 7110.65 4-3-4","Any aircraft that violates a Presidential TFR will be intercepted by military aircraft. The controller's role is to attempt to establish communication with the violating aircraft and instruct it to exit the TFR immediately. All actions must be coordinated with the security agencies monitoring the TFR."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-3","When clearing a parachute jump aircraft into position, the controller must issue an advisory to the pilot when the aircraft is approximately 10 minutes from the proposed jump time. This allows the pilot to prepare for the jump and provides a final opportunity to coordinate any changes."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-4 Note 4","The RECAT separation matrix is more complex than the standard wake turbulence categories. For example, a Boeing 757 is in its own category (Category D) and has specific separation requirements that differ from the traditional 'Large' or 'Heavy' categories. Controllers must have the RECAT chart available for reference."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-1","If a pilot reports a flight control malfunction, the controller should ask for the nature of the problem and how it affects the aircraft's handling. The controller should provide a wide area for maneuvering and avoid issuing any abrupt instructions. The pilot may request a 'straight-in' approach to minimize maneuvering."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-5","In a hijacking situation, the pilot may be forced to communicate in a non-standard way. The controller should listen for any subtle clues or changes in voice or phraseology that might indicate duress. Any suspicion of unlawful interference should be immediately reported to a supervisor."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-3-2","The information gathered for an ALNOT includes the aircraft's call sign, type, departure point, destination, estimated time of arrival, last known position, and the color of the aircraft if known. This detailed information is crucial for an effective search and rescue operation."
"AIM 6-4-3","A flashing white light gun signal directed at an aircraft on the ground means 'Return to starting point on airport.' This signal is used to recall an aircraft that has been cleared to taxi but needs to return to the ramp for some reason."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-13","Military aircraft often use afterburners for takeoff and climb, which can create a significant noise impact. Controllers should be aware of their facility's procedures for afterburner use and may need to advise pilots to restrict their use over certain areas if noise abatement is a factor."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-2-17","A TCAS RA event is not considered a loss of separation by ATC, as the system is designed to be a final safety net. However, the controller must document the event and may be required to file a report detailing the circumstances that led to the RA."
"IVAO US-DIV SOP 6.2","When a controller on IVAO is handling a simulated emergency, they should add 'SIM' to their ATIS remarks. This alerts pilots connecting to the frequency that a training scenario is in progress and that they may experience simulated delays or non-standard vectoring as part of the exercise."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-1","If a pilot declares an emergency but is unable to communicate the nature of the problem, the controller should assume the most serious situation, such as an engine failure or fire. The controller should begin clearing the airspace and preparing for an emergency landing at the nearest suitable airport."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-4","If a NORDO aircraft is approaching an airport, the tower controller should use light gun signals to issue landing and taxi instructions. The controller must also ensure that other aircraft in the pattern are aware of the NORDO aircraft and give it a wide berth."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-20","When a Restricted Area is active, no IFR or VFR aircraft may enter without permission from the controlling agency. The controller must provide a vector around the area. If a pilot insists on flying through, the controller must advise them that they are doing so at their own risk and that separation services are not provided within the restricted area."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-5","The ILS critical area is marked by a sign and pavement markings. When low visibility procedures are in effect, aircraft must hold short of this line, which is further back from the runway than the normal hold short line. This is to prevent signal reflection that could interfere with the ILS localizer and glideslope."
"AIM 4-4-11","A pilot is not required to report a TCAS Traffic Advisory (TA) to ATC. A TA is for situational awareness only. The pilot is only required to report a Resolution Advisory (RA), as this involves a deviation from the current clearance."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-1-1","The controller's judgment is key in an emergency. If a situation appears to be an emergency, even if the pilot has not declared one, the controller should treat it as such. It is always better to be proactive and provide assistance than to wait for the situation to deteriorate."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-2-1","Secondary radar, or beacon radar, relies on a transponder in the aircraft. It provides the controller with more information than primary radar, including the aircraft's identity (squawk code) and pressure altitude (Mode C). Mode S transponders allow for even more data exchange, such as aircraft call sign and TCAS coordination."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-2-7","The 'IDENT' feature causes an aircraft's radar blip to 'blossom' or highlight on the controller's display. It is used as a primary method of radar identification. Phraseology: 'N12345, squawk one two three four and ident.' The controller must not ask a pilot to ident unless it is for identification or to emphasize an aircraft's location."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-3","When an aircraft's transponder appears to be inoperative or malfunctioning, the controller must inform the pilot. Phraseology: 'N12345, your transponder appears inoperative/malfunctioning, recycle transponder, squawk one two three four.' The controller must then use alternative methods for identification and separation."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-3-2","The primary methods for radar identification are: 1. Observing a departing aircraft within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end. 2. Observing an aircraft's position over a known point reported by the pilot. 3. Observing an aircraft's response to an 'IDENT' instruction. Once identified, the controller must inform the pilot. Phraseology: 'N12345, radar contact, [position].'"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-8","If radar contact is lost, the controller must inform the pilot. Phraseology: 'N12345, radar contact lost.' The controller must then transition to non-radar separation procedures and provide instructions based on the aircraft's last known position and clearance. The controller should also attempt to re-establish radar contact."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-6-2","When vectoring a departing aircraft, the controller must ensure the vector does not take the aircraft over terrain or obstructions. The initial vector should be issued as part of the departure instructions. For example: 'N12345, after departure, fly heading zero niner zero.' Vectors are used to integrate the departure into the en route traffic flow."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-6-3","Vectors can be used in the en route phase of flight for separation, weather avoidance, or to provide a more direct routing. The controller must always provide the reason for the vector. Phraseology: 'N12345, fly heading two seven zero, vector for traffic' or '...vector for weather.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-1","Approach sequencing involves arranging arriving aircraft into a safe and orderly flow to the final approach course. This is achieved using vectors (extending downwind, S-turns), speed control, and altitude restrictions. The goal is to establish a consistent spacing between aircraft before they are cleared for the approach."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-4","Wake turbulence separation is based on aircraft categories. The categories are SUPER (A380/AN225), HEAVY (aircraft with MTOW of 300,000 lbs or more), B757 (treated as a special category), LARGE (more than 41,000 lbs up to 300,000 lbs), and SMALL (41,000 lbs or less). Separation minima are increased when a smaller aircraft follows a larger one."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-4 Table 5-5-1","Example of wake turbulence radar separation: When a Small aircraft is directly behind a Heavy aircraft, 6 miles of separation is required. When a Large aircraft is behind a Heavy, 4 miles is required. A Heavy behind a Heavy requires 4 miles. A B757 behind a Heavy requires 4 miles. Controllers must know these pairings."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-6-4","Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) is the lowest MSL altitude at which an IFR aircraft will be vectored by a radar controller. This altitude provides obstacle clearance. MVAs are charted on the controller's map and are not published for pilots. A controller cannot assign an altitude below the MVA unless it is for an approach or in an emergency."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-6","When an aircraft is conducting a pilot-navigated instrument approach (e.g., RNAV, VOR), the controller's role is to provide radar monitoring. The controller will issue advisories if the aircraft deviates significantly from the course. Phraseology: 'N12345, you appear to be left of course.' The pilot is still primarily responsible for navigation."
"FAAO 7110.65 6-3-1","Longitudinal separation is a non-radar method based on time. The standard is 10 minutes between aircraft at the same altitude. This can be reduced if navigational aids can provide accurate position reports. For example, 5 minutes between aircraft if the lead aircraft is at least 22 knots faster than the trailing aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 6-4-1","Lateral separation is achieved by ensuring aircraft are on different routes that are separated by a specific distance or angular difference. For example, two aircraft on different airways whose centerlines are separated by at least 8 miles. Holding patterns are also a form of lateral separation, as the holding airspace is protected."
"FAAO 7110.65 6-3-2","DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) can be used for non-radar longitudinal separation. For example, 20 miles DME separation is required between two aircraft at the same altitude using the same DME facility. This is often used in offshore or mountainous areas where radar coverage is poor."
"FAAO 7110.65 4-5-7","The Mach number technique is used for longitudinal separation of turbojet aircraft in the en route environment. A controller can clear aircraft to maintain a specific Mach number to maintain a time-based separation. For example, if the lead aircraft is maintaining Mach .82, the trailing aircraft may be assigned Mach .80 to create more spacing."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-7-1","Speed control is a primary tool for radar separation. Controllers can issue specific speed assignments to maintain or decrease separation. Phraseology: 'N12345, maintain two five zero knots' or 'N12345, reduce speed to one seven zero knots.' Pilots must advise ATC if they are unable to comply with a speed assignment."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-7-3","Standard speed restrictions apply in certain airspace. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, aircraft must not exceed 250 knots below 10,000 feet MSL. Within 4 NM of the primary airport of a Class C or D airspace, the speed limit is 200 knots. In Class B airspace, the limit is typically 250 knots, with a 200-knot limit under the shelf."
"FAAO 7110.65 4-5-6","Altitude restrictions are used for separation and to ensure obstacle clearance. A crossing restriction is a clearance to cross a specific fix at a specific altitude. Phraseology: 'N12345, cross the ABC VOR at and maintain one zero thousand.' This ensures vertical separation from other traffic that may be on a conflicting route."
"FAAO 7110.65 7-2-1","Visual separation can be applied by a controller if they have both aircraft in sight and can ensure separation. More commonly, it is applied by a pilot. The controller must get confirmation from the pilot that they have the other aircraft in sight and will maintain separation. Phraseology: 'N12345, do you have the traffic at your 12 o'clock in sight?' ... 'N12345, maintain visual separation from that traffic.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-7","Simultaneous independent parallel approaches require that the runway centerlines be at least 4,300 feet apart. A No Transgression Zone (NTZ) of at least 2,000 feet is established between the two final approach courses. Each approach must be monitored by a dedicated controller. If an aircraft penetrates the NTZ, a 'breakout' instruction must be issued immediately."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-7","The breakout phraseology for a simultaneous parallel approach is critical. 'N12345, turn left/right immediately, heading [degrees], climb and maintain [altitude].' This instruction is mandatory and must be executed immediately by the pilot to avoid a potential collision with the aircraft on the adjacent approach."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-10-4","Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO) are an advanced procedure to increase airport capacity. A pilot must accept a LAHSO clearance; they cannot be forced to do so. The controller must provide the available landing distance. Phraseology: 'N12345, Runway 27, cleared to land, hold short of Runway 33. Available landing distance is 6,500 feet.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-10-4","LAHSO is not authorized under certain conditions, including on wet runways, if wind shear has been reported, or if the tailwind exceeds 3 knots. The pilot has the final authority to accept or reject a LAHSO clearance. If they reject it, the controller must provide an alternative clearance."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-15","Inter-facility coordination is the communication between different ATC facilities, such as a Center and an Approach Control. This is typically done via dedicated phone lines or automated systems. Coordination is required for handoffs, route changes that affect another facility's airspace, and any non-standard operation."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-16","A Letter of Agreement (LOA) is a formal document between two or more ATC facilities that establishes procedures for handoffs, airspace delegation, and other routine coordination. For example, an LOA might allow a TRACON to control a portion of a Center's airspace to facilitate arrivals into a busy airport. Controllers must adhere to all LOA procedures."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-5","A 'point out' is an action where a controller electronically identifies an aircraft on another controller's scope, but control is not transferred. This is used when an aircraft will enter another controller's airspace but will not require their control. The receiving controller must approve the point out. Phraseology (over landline): 'Point out, N12345, twenty miles west of ABC, level three five zero.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-3","A handoff must be initiated in time for it to be completed before the aircraft crosses the sector boundary. The transferring controller is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is in a stable condition (not climbing or descending rapidly) and that any pertinent information, such as assigned restrictions, is relayed to the receiving controller."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-3","An automated handoff is initiated by the transferring controller via the radar system, causing the aircraft's data block to flash on the receiving controller's display. The receiving controller accepts the handoff by clicking on the data block. Once accepted, the transferring controller can instruct the pilot to change frequency."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-4","A manual handoff is used when automation is not available. The transferring controller must coordinate verbally with the receiving controller over a landline. The coordination must include the aircraft's call sign, type, position, altitude, and any other relevant information. The receiving controller must verbally accept the handoff."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-3-3","If a pilot is flying a specific route and reports over a fix that is not on that route, the controller must take action to re-identify the aircraft. This may involve asking for a new position report, vectoring the aircraft, or using other identification methods. The controller cannot assume the aircraft is the one they were tracking."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-8","If radar contact is lost with an IFR aircraft, the controller must instruct the pilot to 'resume own navigation' if they were previously being vectored. The controller must also provide the aircraft's last known position and issue a clearance to a fix from which the pilot can continue the flight. Non-radar separation must be applied immediately."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-6-2","A vector must not be issued that would take an aircraft across the final approach course at an angle greater than 30 degrees. The vector should be designed to allow the pilot to smoothly intercept and join the final approach course. This is a critical parameter for a stabilized approach."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-2","When clearing an aircraft for an approach while it is on a vector, the controller must provide the aircraft's position relative to a fix on the approach. Phraseology: 'N12345, seven miles from the final approach fix, turn right heading two five zero, maintain three thousand until established on the localizer, cleared ILS Runway 27 approach.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-4 Table 5-5-1","The B757 is in its own wake turbulence category because it generates unusually strong vortices for its weight class. When a Small aircraft is following a B757, 5 miles of separation is required. This is more than the 4 miles required for a Small following a Large jet."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-6-4","If a pilot reports unable to maintain the MVA, the controller must take immediate action. This may involve issuing a climb instruction or vectoring the aircraft to an area with a lower MVA. The controller cannot allow an aircraft to fly below the MVA except when on a published segment of an approach."
"FAAO 7110.65 6-3-1","In a non-radar environment, if two aircraft are on the same course, the trailing aircraft must be instructed to report leaving an altitude for a lower altitude before the lead aircraft is cleared to descend through that same altitude. This ensures vertical separation is maintained."
"FAAO 7110.65 6-4-1","Lateral separation in a non-radar environment can be established by requiring aircraft to fly on routes that are separated by a minimum of 45 degrees. This requires that the aircraft are using the same navigation aid as the vertex of the angle."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-7-3","Time-based separation at takeoff can be used for aircraft departing from the same runway. For example, a 2-minute interval is required between takeoffs if the lead aircraft is at least 44 knots faster than the trailing aircraft. This ensures the aircraft are separated before they enter the next sector."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-7-2","When assigning a speed reduction, the controller should be aware of the aircraft's performance capabilities. A large speed reduction may be difficult for a clean-configured jet at high altitude. Phraseology for a pilot unable to comply: 'Unable to maintain two five zero knots at this altitude.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 4-5-6","A 'block altitude' clearance assigns a range of altitudes for an aircraft to operate within. Phraseology: 'N12345, maintain block flight level two five zero through two seven zero.' This can be used to allow an aircraft to find a smoother ride or to facilitate climbs and descents through another aircraft's altitude."
"FAAO 7110.65 7-2-1","When a pilot accepts responsibility for visual separation, the controller is not relieved of their responsibility to provide separation from other IFR or VFR aircraft. The controller must continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to intervene if necessary."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-8","Simultaneous dependent parallel approaches require runway centerlines to be between 2,500 and 4,300 feet apart. Aircraft are staggered on the final approach courses, with a minimum of 1.5 miles of diagonal separation required. This procedure does not require a dedicated NTZ monitor."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-10-4","The pilot's readback of a LAHSO clearance must be verbatim, including the hold short point. If the pilot's readback is incorrect, the controller must restate the full clearance and obtain a correct readback before the aircraft crosses the landing threshold."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-15","Coordination between the tower and approach control is essential for managing arrivals and departures. The tower must inform the approach controller of any runway changes or airport closures. The approach controller must provide the tower with an accurate sequence of arriving aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-16","An LOA will specify the procedures for transferring control and communication. For example, it may state that aircraft landing at a satellite airport are automatically handed off from the Center to the Approach control at a specific altitude or fix, without the need for verbal coordination on every aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-5","A point out is not a transfer of control. The controller who initiated the point out is still responsible for separation. The receiving controller's approval of the point out simply acknowledges that they are aware of the traffic."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-3","The phraseology for a frequency change after a handoff is 'Contact [facility name] on [frequency].' The pilot is expected to read back this instruction and switch to the new frequency. The transferring controller should monitor the aircraft until it is established on the new frequency."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-3","If an automated handoff is rejected by the receiving controller, the data block will flash back to the transferring controller. The transferring controller must then coordinate verbally to resolve the issue before the aircraft crosses the sector boundary."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-4-4","In a non-radar environment, handoffs are based on time and position estimates. The transferring controller will provide an estimated time for the aircraft to cross the sector boundary. The receiving controller must acknowledge this and be prepared to assume control at the specified time or fix."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-6","Controllers must advise pilots of hazardous weather that may impact operations within 150 NM of their sector. This includes SIGMETs, Convective SIGMETs, AIRMETs, Center Weather Advisories (CWAs), and urgent PIREPs. The advisory should be broadcast on all frequencies, except for emergency frequencies. Phraseology: 'Attention all aircraft, hazardous weather information for [area] is available on HIWAS, Flight Watch, or Flight Service frequencies.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-8","When a pilot reports wind shear, or when a Low Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS) alert is received, the controller must issue an alert to all arriving and departing aircraft. The alert should be broadcast for 20 minutes following the report. Phraseology: 'Wind shear alert, [location], [type of aircraft] reported a 20-knot loss at 500 feet on final.'"
"AIM 7-1-26","The Low Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS) is a network of sensors around an airport that detects wind shifts associated with microbursts and wind shear. When an alert is triggered, it appears on the controller's display. The controller must relay this information to pilots, for example: 'Wind shear alert, centerfield wind 270 at 10, north boundary wind 350 at 25.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-3","A microburst is a particularly dangerous, localized downdraft. When a microburst is detected by weather radar or reported by a pilot, controllers must issue an alert. Phraseology: 'Microburst alert, a 40-knot loss was reported on the final approach course.' Controllers should avoid vectoring aircraft into areas of known microburst activity."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-4","When a thunderstorm or other convective activity is affecting the airspace, controllers should provide advisories on the location, intensity, and movement of the weather. Pilots may request to deviate from their route to avoid the weather. Controllers should approve these deviations whenever possible, ensuring separation is maintained from other aircraft. Phraseology: 'Attention all aircraft, a line of thunderstorms is located 20 miles west of the airport, moving east at 20 knots.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-2","Controllers must solicit and disseminate Pilot Reports (PIREPs) of icing conditions. When a pilot reports icing, the controller must ask for the type, intensity, and altitude of the icing. This information must be relayed to other aircraft and to the weather service. Phraseology: 'N12345, report icing conditions.'"
"AIM 7-1-22","Turbulence is reported in intensities of light, moderate, severe, or extreme. When a pilot reports turbulence, the controller must ask for the altitude and location of the event. This PIREP is then broadcast to other aircraft and facilities. Phraseology: 'Attention all aircraft, moderate turbulence reported at flight level three one zero, 30 miles east of the ABC VOR.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-2","Runway condition reports are critical for pilot braking action estimates. Controllers relay braking action reports from pilots using the terms 'good,' 'good to medium,' 'medium,' 'medium to poor,' 'poor,' or 'nil.' A report of 'nil' braking action requires the controller to cease operations on that runway. Phraseology: 'Braking action advisory, a Boeing 737 reports braking action poor on Runway 27.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 7-4-4","When the airport weather is below basic VFR minimums (1,000-foot ceiling and 3 miles visibility), Special VFR (SVFR) operations may be authorized. This allows VFR aircraft to operate within the surface area if they can remain clear of clouds and have at least 1 mile of flight visibility. SVFR is only approved if IFR traffic permits."
"14 CFR 91.175","The pilot, not the controller, is responsible for determining if weather conditions are at or above the minimums for a specific instrument approach. The controller's responsibility is to provide the latest official weather report to the pilot. The pilot makes the final decision to begin or continue an approach based on that information."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-5-2","Progressive taxi instructions are issued when a pilot is unfamiliar with the airport or when the taxi route is complex. The controller provides step-by-step instructions. Phraseology: 'N12345, turn left on Taxiway Charlie. Now turn right on Alpha. Hold short of Runway 27.' This requires more frequency time but enhances safety."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-15","Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X) or Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC) is a system that provides a detailed map of the airport surface on the controller's display. It tracks the position of aircraft and vehicles, helping to prevent runway incursions, especially in low visibility."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-7-2","Runway incursion prevention is a top priority. Controllers must issue clear, concise instructions and receive a correct readback for all runway crossing and hold short instructions. They must maintain constant visual or radar surveillance of the runways and be alert for any unauthorized movements."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-5","Vehicles operating in the airport movement area must be controlled by the appropriate ATC position (Ground or Tower). Vehicle drivers must have two-way radio contact with ATC and must receive explicit instructions to enter, cross, or operate on any runway or taxiway. Phraseology: 'Airport 1, proceed via Taxiway Alpha to the VOR. Hold short of Runway 27.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-1","Controllers must be aware of all airport construction and its impact on operations. This information is published in NOTAMs. The controller must coordinate with airport operations to ensure that closed taxiways and runways are properly marked and that all personnel are aware of the active work areas."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-22","Controllers operate various airport lighting systems. This includes runway edge lights, taxiway lights, and approach lighting systems (e.g., ALSF-2, MALSR). The intensity of the lighting can be adjusted as requested by pilots or as required by visibility conditions. For example, runway lights are typically set to high intensity during the day and lower at night."
"AIM 2-1-2","The Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) and Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) are visual aids that provide glideslope guidance to pilots. A PAPI shows four lights in a row: 'Four whites, you're high; four reds, you're low.' Two white and two red indicates the correct glideslope. While pilots use these, controllers must be aware if they are reported as inoperative."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-4-4","During an emergency, the tower controller is the primary link to the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team. The controller must provide the ARFF commander with the aircraft's location, type, number of persons on board, and amount of fuel remaining. This information is critical for planning the emergency response."
"AIM 7-5-12","Bird activity is a significant hazard. The Airport's Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program coordinates mitigation efforts. Controllers must issue advisories when bird activity is observed or reported. Phraseology: 'Attention all aircraft, bird activity reported in the vicinity of the approach end of Runway 27.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-3","Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on a runway or taxiway is a serious safety hazard. If a pilot or vehicle reports FOD, the controller must notify airport operations to have it removed. If it is on a runway, the controller should not allow any aircraft to use that runway until it is confirmed to be clear."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-13","Push-back procedures from a gate are typically managed by the airline's ground crew, often on a separate ramp control frequency. However, the ground controller must approve the push-back into a movement area (taxiway). Phraseology: 'N12345, push-back approved, advise when ready to taxi.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-6","Gate hold procedures are used to manage traffic flow and reduce airborne holding. The tower or clearance delivery will instruct aircraft to hold at the gate. Phraseology: 'N12345, hold for release, expect departure at one eight three zero Zulu.' This is part of a larger traffic management initiative."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-6","A Ground Stop (GS) is a traffic management initiative that halts all traffic destined for a specific airport. A Ground Delay Program (GDP) assigns aircraft departure times to manage volume. Local controllers are responsible for implementing these programs by issuing gate holds and release times."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-14","De-icing operations are common in winter conditions. Controllers must coordinate with the de-icing facility to manage the flow of aircraft to and from the de-icing pads. A pilot's 'holdover time' (the time the de-icing fluid is effective) is critical, so controllers should try to expedite their departure after de-icing is complete."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-7","Fuel dumping is done when an aircraft needs to reduce its weight for landing. The controller must vector the aircraft to a designated fuel dumping area, typically at a high altitude and away from populated areas. The controller must broadcast a warning to other aircraft and apply separation standards to the airspace where fuel is being dumped."
"AIM Chapter 5","While the pilot is responsible for aircraft weight and balance, it affects ATC operations. A heavily loaded aircraft will have a slower climb rate and may require a longer takeoff roll. This must be considered by the controller when sequencing departures and planning climbs."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-6","A Center Weather Advisory (CWA) is an unscheduled weather advisory for conditions beginning within the next 2 hours. CWAs are issued by the Center Weather Service Unit (CWSU) located at each ARTCC. Controllers must broadcast CWAs to alert pilots of short-term, hazardous weather conditions."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-8","When issuing a wind shear alert based on pilot reports, the controller must include the position of the report and the altitude. This gives the following pilot a precise location to expect the phenomenon. For example: 'Wind shear alert, a Boeing 737 reported a 15-knot gain on a 2-mile final.'"
"AIM 7-1-26","The LLWAS is particularly effective at detecting the gust fronts associated with thunderstorms. An alert from the LLWAS is a strong indicator of potential microburst activity, and controllers must treat it with high priority, issuing immediate alerts to aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-4","Controllers should not vector an aircraft into an area of known severe weather. If a pilot insists on flying through such an area, the controller should advise them that they are doing so at their own risk and that radar services may be terminated. Phraseology: 'N12345, unable to provide vectors through that area of weather. Deviation is at your own risk.'"
"AIM 7-1-21","Icing PIREPs are critical for flight safety. When a pilot reports icing, the controller should ask for the outside air temperature if possible. This helps other pilots and meteorologists determine the atmospheric conditions conducive to icing."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-2","When disseminating a turbulence PIREP, the controller must include the aircraft type. This is because a given atmospheric condition may cause severe turbulence for a small aircraft but only light turbulence for a heavy jet. This context is important for other pilots."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-2","A Runway Condition Code (RCC) is a number from 0 to 6 that describes the runway condition (e.g., dry, wet, icy). Controllers provide the RCCs to pilots, who use them to calculate their aircraft's expected landing or takeoff performance. For example: 'Runway 27 condition codes are five, five, five.'"
"14 CFR 91.155","In Class G airspace, VFR weather minimums are typically 1 mile visibility and clear of clouds. However, above 10,000 feet MSL, they increase to 5 miles visibility. Controllers must be aware of the airspace classification and applicable weather minimums when providing services to VFR aircraft."
"AIM 5-4-20","If the reported weather is below the published minimums for an approach, the pilot is not authorized to begin the final approach segment. However, if the pilot has already started the final approach segment when the weather drops, they are permitted to continue the approach to the Decision Altitude (DA) or Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA)."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-5-2","A request for 'progressive taxi' indicates the pilot is unfamiliar with the airport. The controller must provide clear, turn-by-turn instructions until the pilot is confident of their position. This is a high-workload procedure but is essential for safety."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-15","ASDE-X provides safety alerts to controllers, such as predicting a potential runway collision. The system will flash and provide an audible alarm, allowing the controller to take immediate action to prevent an incident."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-7-2","A key runway incursion prevention technique is to avoid issuing a takeoff clearance until the preceding aircraft has passed a certain point on the runway or is airborne. This 'one aircraft on the runway at a time' philosophy is a cornerstone of tower control."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-5","Vehicle drivers on the movement area must use standard aviation phraseology and read back all instructions. A common error is for a vehicle to acknowledge with 'roger' instead of a full readback of the instruction, which is not acceptable for runway crossing or hold short instructions."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-1","When a taxiway is closed, controllers must ensure it is not used. They should issue explicit instructions to taxi via an alternative route. If a pilot requests to use a closed taxiway, the controller must deny the request and state the reason. Phraseology: 'N12345, unable, Taxiway Bravo is closed for construction.'"
"AIM 2-1-9","The Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are a pair of flashing white lights on either side of the runway threshold. They are used to help pilots identify the approach end of a runway, especially in low visibility. The tower controller can adjust their intensity or turn them on and off."
"AIM 2-1-2","A PAPI system has a very precise vertical beam. If a pilot reports the PAPI is unusable or providing an incorrect indication, the controller must notify airport operations to have it checked. The controller should also advise other pilots that the PAPI is unreliable."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-4-4","In an emergency, the controller must ask the pilot for the number of 'souls on board' (SOB). This term includes all persons on the aircraft, both crew and passengers. This information is passed to the ARFF commander to prepare for a potential rescue operation."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-7","When bird activity is reported, the controller should issue an advisory for at least 15 minutes. If the activity is persistent, it may be included in the ATIS broadcast. For example: 'Caution, flock of birds reported in the vicinity of the departure end of Runway 27.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-3","If FOD is reported, the controller must determine its exact location and nature if possible. If it is something small and easily retrievable, airport operations may be able to remove it quickly. If it is a large piece of debris, the runway or taxiway may need to be closed for an extended period."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-13","Some airports have designated 'powerback' positions where aircraft can use reverse thrust to push back from the gate. This requires specific approval from ATC, as the jet blast can be a hazard to other aircraft and ground personnel."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-6","When a Ground Delay Program is in effect, aircraft are assigned an 'Expect Departure Clearance Time' (EDCT). Pilots are expected to be ready for departure at their EDCT. The controller is responsible for sequencing these departures according to the assigned times."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-14","After de-icing, an aircraft has a limited 'holdover time' before the fluid loses its effectiveness. If the aircraft's departure is delayed beyond this time, it must return for re-treatment. Controllers must be aware of this and try to get de-iced aircraft airborne as quickly as possible."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-7","When an aircraft is dumping fuel, the controller must apply a minimum of 5 miles of lateral separation or 2,000 feet of vertical separation to all other traffic from the fuel dumping area. The advisory to other aircraft should be broadcast for at least 3 minutes after the dumping has stopped."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-5-4","An aircraft's weight category (e.g., Heavy, Large, Small) is a key factor in determining the required wake turbulence separation. The controller must know the weight category of each aircraft they are controlling to apply the correct separation standard."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-6","When a CWA is issued for a particular phenomenon, such as turbulence or icing, it will include a specific altitude range. The controller must relay this information to pilots so they can determine if it affects their flight path. For example: 'Center Weather Advisory, moderate icing from flight level two two zero to two six zero.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-8","A gain or loss of airspeed on final approach is a classic sign of wind shear. A pilot report of such an event is considered a reliable indicator, and the controller must issue an alert immediately. The type of aircraft reporting the shear is important, as a larger aircraft may be less affected than a smaller one."
"AIM 7-1-26","The LLWAS provides alerts for specific runways. The controller's alert to the pilot must include the runway affected. Phraseology: 'Wind shear alert for Runway 27, a 30-knot loss was reported on a 1-mile final.'"
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-4","When vectoring an aircraft around a thunderstorm, the controller should provide a buffer of at least 10-20 miles from the most intense parts of the storm, as turbulence and hail can be present far from the visible storm cloud."
"AIM 7-1-21","There are different types of icing: rime, clear, and mixed. Clear ice is the most dangerous as it is heavy and can disrupt airflow over the wings. When a pilot reports icing, the controller should ask for the type if the pilot knows it."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-6-2","A report of 'extreme' turbulence means the aircraft is being violently tossed about and is practically impossible to control. This is a hazardous condition, and the controller must immediately issue an alert to all aircraft in the area and recommend they avoid the affected airspace."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-2","If a pilot reports 'nil' braking action, the runway is considered unsafe for further operations. The controller must inform airport operations and close the runway until its condition can be improved and re-evaluated."
"14 CFR 91.157","To operate under SVFR at night, the pilot must be instrument-rated, and the aircraft must be equipped for instrument flight. This is an extra layer of safety for night SVFR operations, which are inherently more risky."
"AIM 5-4-20","A controller can provide a pilot with the RVR (Runway Visual Range) value for a specific runway. RVR is a more precise measure of visibility along the runway and is often the controlling factor for determining if an approach can be initiated, especially for CAT II/III operations."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-15","The safety logic in ASDE-X can predict when an aircraft's current track will result in a runway incursion. This gives the controller a few seconds of advance warning to issue a corrective instruction, which can be the difference between a close call and an accident."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-5","Any vehicle operating in the movement area must have a flashing yellow light on its roof. This makes it more visible to pilots and controllers, especially at night or in low visibility."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-3-1","When a runway is closed, the controller must ensure that the runway lighting is turned off, unless it is needed for a specific operation. This provides a clear visual cue to pilots that the runway is not in use."
"AIM 2-1-9","The approach lighting system (ALS) can be very complex, with multiple settings. The controller can adjust the intensity of the ALS as requested by the pilot. For example, a pilot may request a lower intensity at night to avoid being blinded."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-4-4","The ARFF commander has the authority to close a runway after an incident. The controller cannot reopen the runway until the ARFF commander has declared it safe and clear of all personnel and equipment."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-13","When an aircraft pushes back from the gate, the ground controller must ensure that the taxiway behind the aircraft is clear of other traffic. This is especially important for large aircraft, as their tail can swing out a significant distance."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-6","A Ground Delay Program is implemented by the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC). The local facility receives a list of flights and their assigned EDCTs. The tower is responsible for ensuring that aircraft depart as close to their EDCT as possible to maintain the integrity of the program."
"ICAO Doc 4444","ICAO standards, outlined in Doc 4444, form the basis for global aviation but have notable differences from U.S. FAA procedures. A key difference is the Transition Altitude (TA). In the U.S., the TA is fixed at 18,000 feet, where pilots switch to standard pressure and use 'Flight Levels.' In most other countries, the TA varies by airport and is published on charts. Phraseology also differs significantly; for example, ICAO allows conditional runway clearances like 'Behind the landing Boeing 737, line up behind,' whereas the FAA strictly prohibits any conditional runway instructions to prevent incursions."
"Human Factors: Situational Awareness","Situational Awareness (SA) is a controller's accurate perception of current factors and conditions that affect the airspace and their ability to project future events. Loss of SA can lead to errors. It is maintained by effective scanning, managing workload, and building a correct mental picture of the traffic. A common sign of losing SA is confusion or uncertainty about an aircraft's position or clearance."
"Human Factors: Workload Management","Controllers must actively manage their workload to prevent overload. This involves prioritizing tasks (separating aircraft first), using effective scanning techniques, and communicating efficiently. During periods of high traffic, controllers should avoid non-essential tasks and focus solely on safety-critical functions. Recognizing personal limits and asking for help are signs of a professional controller."
"Human Factors: Readback/Hearback Errors","A readback/hearback error occurs when a pilot reads back a clearance incorrectly and the controller fails to catch the error. This is a common cause of incidents. Controllers must listen carefully to every readback. If a readback is incorrect, the controller must make a corrective transmission with the correct clearance. Phraseology: 'Negative, [call sign], I say again...'"
"Human Factors: Expectation Bias","Expectation bias is the tendency to hear what you expect to hear. For example, if a controller expects a pilot to report leaving an altitude, they may 'hear' that transmission even if the pilot said something else. To mitigate this, controllers must listen actively and attentively to the actual words spoken, not just the anticipated message."
"Human Factors: Stress Management","Air traffic control is a high-stress job. Controllers must develop coping mechanisms for stress. This includes staying calm under pressure, relying on training and procedures, and using effective communication. After a stressful event, a debriefing can be a valuable tool for processing the situation and learning from it."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-24","A Call for Release (CFR) procedure is used when a departure airport is in close proximity to the overlying ARTCC's airspace. The ground or clearance delivery controller must call the center controller to get a release time for the departing aircraft. This ensures the departure can be integrated into the en route flow without causing a loss of separation."
"Traffic Management: Airspace Flow Program (AFP)","An Airspace Flow Program (AFP) is a traffic management initiative that assigns departure times to aircraft that are expected to fly through a specific, constrained piece of airspace. This is different from a GDP (which is airport-specific). An AFP helps to manage volume and prevent airborne holding over a congested area or due to weather."
"Traffic Management: Time Based Flow Management (TBFM)","Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) is a system that helps controllers sequence aircraft to a specific point, such as the final approach fix, at a precise time. The system provides controllers with suggested headings and speeds to achieve the required spacing. This creates a more efficient and orderly flow of traffic."
"Traffic Management: Miles-in-Trail","A 'miles-in-trail' restriction is a traffic management tool where controllers must ensure a specific number of miles between aircraft on the same route. Phraseology: 'Maintain 20 miles in trail with the aircraft ahead.' This is used to manage volume into a busy airport or sector."
"Traffic Management: Minutes-in-Trail","Similar to miles-in-trail, a 'minutes-in-trail' restriction is used in non-radar environments. The controller must ensure a specific time interval between aircraft passing the same reporting point. This is a common procedure in oceanic airspace."
"Advanced Scenario: Pop-up IFR","A VFR aircraft may request an IFR clearance 'in the air' due to deteriorating weather. The controller must first ensure the aircraft is in a safe position (away from terrain and other traffic) and can maintain its altitude. The controller will then coordinate for a clearance, which may take time. The priority is to keep the aircraft safe while the clearance is being processed."
"Advanced Scenario: Mixed Fleet Sequencing","Sequencing a fast jet (e.g., a regional jet) behind a slow turboprop (e.g., a Dash 8) for the same runway requires careful speed control. The controller may need to assign a higher speed to the turboprop and a lower speed to the jet, or use vectoring to create extra spacing, to prevent the jet from overtaking the turboprop on final."
"Advanced Scenario: Stuck Flaps","If a pilot reports a stuck flap condition, the controller must anticipate a non-standard approach speed. The pilot will likely fly faster than normal on final. The controller must provide extra spacing behind the aircraft, as it will have a longer landing roll. The controller should also ask for the pilot's intended approach speed to help with sequencing."
"Advanced Scenario: VFR Flight Following","When providing VFR flight following, the controller's primary responsibility is workload permitting. The controller provides traffic advisories but is not responsible for separation. If the VFR aircraft is approaching complex airspace like a Class B, the controller should proactively advise the pilot of the airspace boundary and the need for a clearance to enter."
"Advanced Scenario: Large-Scale Military Exercise","Coordinating a large military exercise involves establishing temporary routes, reserving blocks of airspace (ALTRVs), and coordinating with numerous military and civilian agencies. The controller's role is to ensure that all non-participating aircraft are kept clear of the exercise airspace and that the military aircraft are handled according to the pre-planned procedures."
"FAAO 7110.65 2-1-25","A 'stop stream' or 'stop departures' instruction may be issued by a TRACON or Center to a tower to halt all departures that will fly a specific route. This is an immediate, tactical measure to resolve a developing situation, such as a sudden loss of separation or an emergency."
"Human Factors: Complacency","Complacency can develop during periods of low workload or routine traffic. It is a dangerous state where the controller's vigilance decreases. To combat complacency, controllers should remain actively engaged, scan the entire scope even with few aircraft, and anticipate potential problems before they occur."
"Traffic Management: Reroutes","During major weather events, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) may issue mandatory reroutes for large flows of traffic. Controllers will receive these reroutes and are responsible for issuing them to the affected aircraft. Phraseology: 'N12345, I have an amendment to your route. Advise when ready to copy.'"
"Advanced Scenario: Circling Approach","A circling approach is used when the final approach course is not aligned with the landing runway. After descending to the circling MDA, the pilot must keep the airport in sight while maneuvering to land on a different runway. The controller must protect a larger area of airspace around the airport to accommodate the circling maneuver."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-9-7","The final monitor controller for simultaneous independent parallel approaches has a unique responsibility. They do not talk to the aircraft unless a deviation occurs. Their sole job is to monitor the NTZ and issue a breakout instruction if an aircraft strays off course. This single-minded focus is a critical safety feature."
"Human Factors: Memory","Controllers cannot rely on memory alone. Critical information, such as assigned altitudes or unusual clearances, should be recorded on flight progress strips or using electronic equivalents. This provides a backup and helps to maintain an accurate picture of the traffic situation."
"Traffic Management: Severe Weather Avoidance Plan (SWAP)","SWAP is a comprehensive plan for managing air traffic around major convective weather systems. It involves a combination of reroutes, ground stops, and flow programs to keep aircraft out of hazardous weather and manage the resulting congestion."
"Advanced Scenario: Intercepting a Hijacked Aircraft","If military aircraft are scrambled to intercept a hijacked aircraft (squawking 7500), the controller's role is to provide vectors to the military pilots to help them join up with the target aircraft. The controller will then act as a communication relay between the military and the security agencies on the ground."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-1-6","A controller must not issue any instruction that would cause a pilot to violate a regulation, such as flying below a minimum safe altitude. If a pilot requests such a clearance, the controller must deny the request. Phraseology: 'Unable, that would be below the minimum vectoring altitude.'"
"IVAO Manuals","The IVAO rating system for controllers is a progression of skills. It starts with Student 1/2 (AS1/AS2), then Aerodrome Controller (ADC), Approach Controller (APC), Center Controller (ACC), and finally Senior Controller (SEC). Each rating requires passing theoretical and practical exams, demonstrating proficiency in the procedures for that level of control."
"IVAO Rules and Regulations 2.1.1","When connecting to the IVAO network as an ATC, you must use approved software like IvAc. You must connect to a valid ATC position within a real-world FIR, have the appropriate rating for that position, and not use a callsign that could be mistaken for a real-world military or official callsign."
"IVAO IvAc Manual","Virtual Airline (VA) coordination is key for events. Controllers should be aware of VA flight schedules and be prepared for concentrated waves of traffic. If a VA is running an event, the controller should coordinate with the VA event organizer to understand the planned routes and timing to ensure a smooth operation."
"IVAO Events Department SOP","During official IVAO events, traffic can be extremely high. Controllers must adhere strictly to event procedures, which may include specific routes, temporary holding patterns, or restrictions on VFR traffic. Coordination between controllers is paramount, and supervisors are often online to assist with any issues."
"IVAO IvAc Manual","The IvAc software includes essential tools for controllers. The communications box is used for voice and text, the radar screen displays traffic, and flight strips help manage aircraft data. Controllers must be proficient in using features like assuming/transferring control, setting up the ATIS, and using the transponder code list."
"IVAO Rules and Regulations 1.4","IVAO has a strict set of rules and regulations that all members must follow. Violations, such as unprofessional behavior, cheating on exams, or connecting to a position without the proper rating, can result in suspension or removal from the network. The rules are enforced by supervisors and administrators."
"IVAO Training Department","Many IVAO divisions encourage cross-training, where real-world pilots and controllers can share their knowledge. While virtual ATC simulates real procedures, it cannot replicate the real-world environment entirely. This exchange of knowledge helps to improve the realism and quality of the simulation for everyone."
"IVAO Website","IVAO provides extensive documentation. The primary resources are the IVAO Manuals (for global procedures), the division's website (for local SOPs and procedures), and the forum. Before controlling in a new area, it is mandatory to review the local procedures for that specific FIR or airport."
"Training Scenario: High Traffic Volume","Scenario: You are the approach controller for a major hub airport during an event. You have a stream of 15 aircraft inbound, all arriving within a 20-minute window. Your task is to maintain separation, sequence them for the ILS approach, and manage their speeds effectively. This tests your ability to prioritize, issue concise instructions, and build a mental picture of the entire arrival flow."
"Training Scenario: Multiple Emergencies","Scenario: While working tower, a landing aircraft reports a blown tire and is disabled on the runway. Simultaneously, an inbound aircraft on a 5-mile final declares a medical emergency and needs to land immediately. Your task is to coordinate with ARFF, close the blocked runway, open a parallel runway, and safely land the emergency aircraft while managing other traffic."
"Training Scenario: System Failure","Scenario: Your radar client (IvAc) suddenly freezes and disconnects. You are handling 10 aircraft in your sector. Your task is to immediately attempt to reconnect. If unable, you must use backup communication (e.g., Discord) to notify a supervisor and adjacent controllers. You must mentally recall the last known position and clearance of each aircraft to help the next controller re-establish control."
"Training Scenario: Trainee Evaluation","Scenario: A trainee controller is being evaluated for their ADC rating. The examiner will act as multiple pilots, testing the trainee's ability to handle ground control, issue correct takeoff and landing clearances, manage the traffic pattern, and correctly apply wake turbulence separation. The examiner may introduce a non-standard request, like a helicopter operation, to test adaptability."
"Training Scenario: Common Student Errors","Scenario: A student ground controller taxis an aircraft via a complex route but forgets to get a readback of the hold short instruction. The trainer, acting as the pilot, will intentionally cross the hold short line. This forces the student to recognize the error, issue a corrective instruction, and reinforces the critical importance of the hearback loop."
"Training Scenario: Progressive Difficulty","Scenario: A training session begins with the student controlling only the ground position at a quiet airport. As they show proficiency, the trainer adds the tower position. Then, traffic volume is slowly increased. Finally, a VFR aircraft requests pattern work, and a pop-up IFR requests a clearance, progressively increasing the workload and complexity."
"Training Scenario: Multi-Facility Coordination","Scenario: A planned exercise involves the Center, Approach, and Tower positions for a specific airport all being staffed. The goal is to manage a flow of traffic from the en route structure, through the TRACON, to a safe landing. The exercise tests the controllers' ability to provide smooth handoffs, coordinate altitude changes, and communicate any restrictions or delays."
"Training Scenario: Controller Stress Management","Scenario: The controller is faced with a rapidly developing thunderstorm over the airport, a NORDO aircraft inbound, and increasing frequency congestion. This scenario is designed to test the controller's ability to remain calm, prioritize the most critical threats (safety over flow), and use clear, concise communication to manage the situation without becoming overwhelmed."
"Practical Application: Efficient Phraseology","Instead of 'N12345, taxi to runway 27.' ... 'N12345, contact tower on 118.1,' a more efficient transmission is: 'N12345, taxi to runway 27 via taxiway Alpha. When ready for departure, contact tower on 118.1.' This combines two instructions into one, reducing frequency congestion."
"Practical Application: Time Management","Use the time during low workload to plan for high workload. Review flight plans for upcoming arrivals, pre-plan your descent points and sequencing, and coordinate with other controllers in advance. This 'staying ahead of the airplane' mentality is key to effective time management."
"Practical Application: Workload Prioritization","In a busy sector, use the ABCs of priority: A - Aviate (ensure aircraft are separated and flying safely), B - Boundaries (manage aircraft at your sector boundaries via handoffs), C - Clearances (issue new clearances or amendments). Non-essential communication can wait."
"Practical Application: Equipment Failure","If your voice connection fails but your radar client is still working, immediately switch to text. Type in the main frequency: 'All stations, voice server down, switching to text only.' This informs all pilots of the situation and allows you to continue controlling while troubleshooting the voice issue."
"Practical Application: Backup Communication","Many IVAO divisions use Discord or Teamspeak for controller-to-controller coordination. This is an essential backup tool. If the network text system fails or you need to have a complex discussion with another controller, use the backup channel. It is not for issuing clearances to pilots."
"Practical Application: Performance Standards","A key performance metric on IVAO is accuracy. A controller should strive for 100% accuracy in issuing clearances and catching readback errors. Efficiency (aircraft per hour) is secondary to safety and accuracy. A safe, accurate controller is a good controller, regardless of speed."
"Practical Application: Quality Assurance","Supervisors and trainers will periodically monitor your controlling sessions to provide feedback. This is a quality assurance measure to ensure standards are being met. View this as a positive learning opportunity to improve your skills."
"Practical Application: Continuing Education","The aviation world is always changing. As an IVAO controller, you are expected to stay current with changes to real-world procedures (e.g., new 7110.65 updates) and IVAO-specific rules. Regularly check the IVAO forum and your division's website for updates."
"IVAO IvAc Manual","The ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) in IvAc must be set up correctly. It should include the airport ICAO code, the ATIS identifier letter, the time of the observation, wind direction and speed, visibility, cloud cover, temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting. It should also include the active runways and any important remarks."
"IVAO Rules and Regulations 2.5.2","Text communication is a valid form of ATC on IVAO. It is used when a pilot or controller does not have a microphone, or when voice servers are down. Controllers must respond to text messages as they would to voice calls. All clearances issued via text must be fully typed out and are still legally binding in the simulation."
"IVAO IvAc Manual","A supervisor can be contacted via a '.wallop' message in IvAc. This sends a message to all online supervisors and administrators. Use this for urgent situations, such as a network rule violation, a stuck microphone you cannot resolve, or a request for assistance with a difficult situation. Do not use it for casual conversation."
"IVAO IvAc Manual","The '.forceact' command allows a controller to change an aircraft's primary frequency. This should only be used as a last resort if an aircraft has been instructed to change frequency, has acknowledged, but has failed to do so after a reasonable amount of time. It is considered an aggressive action and should be used with caution."
"IVAO Website","The IVAO Training Department is responsible for all member training and examinations. To request a training session or an exam, you must use the scheduling system on the IVAO website. A certified trainer from your division will then be assigned to you."
"IVAO Rules and Regulations 2.6.1","Unicom (122.800) is the designated frequency for pilots to self-announce their positions and intentions when no ATC is online. It is not for chatting. Transmissions should be concise and follow a standard format, such as '[Airport] traffic, [call sign], [position], [intention].'"
"IVAO IvAc Manual","When handing off an aircraft in IvAc, the transferring controller will select the aircraft and the next controller's position. The data block will flash on the receiving controller's scope. The receiving controller must 'assume' the aircraft by clicking on it. Only after the aircraft is assumed should the pilot be instructed to change frequency."
"Training Scenario: Runway Incursion","Scenario: You clear an aircraft for takeoff. As it begins its takeoff roll, a VFR aircraft that was holding short of the runway enters the runway without clearance. Your immediate actions are: 1. Cancel the takeoff clearance ('N12345, cancel takeoff clearance, hold position!'). 2. Issue an instruction to the other aircraft ('N54321, exit the runway immediately!'). 3. Report the incident."
"Training Scenario: VFR into IMC","Scenario: A VFR pilot on flight following reports that the weather has deteriorated unexpectedly, and they are now in the clouds. They are not instrument-rated. Your immediate priority is safety. Issue a heading to fly away from known terrain or obstacles and an altitude to climb to. Declare an emergency for the aircraft and coordinate with all other traffic to provide a safe path while you work on a plan."
"Training Scenario: Missed Approach Conga Line","Scenario: The RVR for the landing runway suddenly drops below minimums. The first aircraft on final executes a missed approach. You must issue missed approach instructions, then immediately vector the second aircraft off the approach course and issue holding instructions. This tests your ability to react quickly and manage a sudden, high-workload situation."
"Common Error: Altitude Bust","Scenario: A student controller clears an aircraft to descend to 5,000 feet. The pilot correctly reads it back. Later, the controller sees the aircraft has descended through 5,000 and is at 4,500. The trainer will ask the student what they should do. The correct action is to immediately issue a corrective instruction: 'N12345, confirm your assigned altitude. You were cleared to maintain five thousand. Climb and maintain five thousand immediately.'"
"Practical Application: Anticipatory Control","If you see two aircraft on a collision course 20 miles apart, don't wait until they are 6 miles apart to react. Issue a small heading or altitude change early. This 'anticipatory control' results in a much smoother, safer, and less stressful operation than constantly reacting to imminent problems."
"Practical Application: Sterile Cockpit for ATC","Just as pilots have a 'sterile cockpit' rule during critical phases of flight, controllers should have a 'sterile position' during busy periods. Avoid all non-essential conversation, private messages, or tasks. Focus 100% of your attention on the radar scope and the frequency until the workload decreases."
"Practical Application: Group Transmissions","If the weather changes, instead of informing each aircraft individually, use a group transmission. 'All aircraft on my frequency, be advised, the wind at the airport is now three five zero at one five, gusting two five. New ATIS information is Charlie.' This saves significant time."
"Practical Application: 'Say Again' is Your Friend","Never assume you understood a garbled or unclear transmission. There is no shame in asking a pilot to repeat themselves. Phraseology: 'N12345, say again, you were unreadable.' A few seconds of clarification can prevent a major error."
"IVAO Rules and Regulations 2.1.4","Connecting to an ATC position for less than 15 minutes without a valid reason (e.g., technical issues) is considered 'flashing' and is discouraged. Controllers are expected to remain online for a reasonable period to provide a consistent service to pilots."
"IVAO Events Department SOP","For 'Real Flight Operations' (RFO) events, controllers are expected to handle a high volume of traffic based on real-world airline schedules. This requires careful planning and adherence to the published event procedures. It is one of the most challenging and rewarding types of events on the network."
"Training Scenario: Language Barrier","Scenario: A pilot with very limited English proficiency is on your frequency. They are not correctly reading back instructions. Your task is to slow down, use only the most basic ICAO standard phraseology, and break down complex clearances into simple, individual steps. For example, issue a heading, get a readback, then issue an altitude, get a readback."
"Common Error: Forgetting the EFC","Scenario: A student controller issues a holding clearance but forgets to give an Expect Further Clearance (EFC) time. The trainer, as the pilot, will ask, 'What is our EFC?' This reinforces that a holding clearance is incomplete without an EFC, as it is critical information for the pilot, especially in a lost-comm situation."
"Practical Application: Post-Session Debrief","After every controlling session, especially a busy or challenging one, take a few minutes to debrief yourself. What went well? What could have been better? What did you learn? This habit of self-reflection is one of the fastest ways to improve your skills as a controller."
"IVAO IvAc Manual","The 'squawk standby' command is used when an aircraft is on the ground and not moving. This reduces clutter on the radar screen. The controller should instruct the pilot to 'squawk normal' or 'squawk charlie' just before issuing the taxi clearance. Phraseology: 'N12345, squawk charlie, taxi to runway 27...'"
"Training Scenario: The Unexpected Diversion","Scenario: An aircraft destined for your airport declares they must divert to their alternate due to a passenger issue. Your task is to quickly coordinate a new route with the adjacent controller, issue the amended clearance to the pilot, and hand them off in a safe and orderly manner, all while continuing to manage your other traffic."
"Practical Application: Knowing Your Airspace","Before logging on, study the charts for your airspace. Know your MVA (Minimum Vectoring Altitude), major airways, common arrival and departure gates, and any special use airspace. Having this knowledge readily available in your mind, rather than having to look it up, will dramatically improve your efficiency and confidence."
"FAAO 7110.65 5-1-6","A Ground Delay Program (GDP) is a traffic management initiative where aircraft are assigned an Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT) to manage volume at a destination airport. The goal is to meter departures so that they do not overwhelm the arrival airport's capacity. Controllers must ensure aircraft depart at or near their assigned EDCT."
"Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS)","Arrival Metering is a process, often managed by a Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) system, that calculates arrival times for aircraft to a specific runway threshold. Controllers then use speed control and vectoring to meet these assigned times, creating a perfectly spaced, efficient stream of traffic and reducing the need for airborne holding."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-2-1","Departure sequencing is the responsibility of the tower controller. During traffic management initiatives, the controller must sequence departing aircraft to meet their assigned release times or EDCTs. This may require holding some aircraft while allowing others to depart out of their normal turn to meet the program's requirements."
"FAAO 7110.65 6-5-5","Miles-in-trail (MIT) restrictions are a common flow control tool where a specific number of miles is required between aircraft on the same route. The restriction is issued by the ARTCC and passed down to underlying sectors. Phraseology: 'N12345, maintain 15 miles in trail with the preceding aircraft.'"
"National Playbook","Playbook routes are pre-coordinated, alternative routes designed to bypass major constraints like severe weather, military exercises, or equipment outages. When a playbook route is activated, controllers will issue clearances to reroute affected aircraft along these published, alternative paths."
"Traffic Management Initiatives (TMI)","A Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) is a general term for any procedure used to manage air traffic flow. This includes Ground Stops (GS), Ground Delay Programs (GDP), Airspace Flow Programs (AFP), reroutes, and miles-in-trail restrictions. Controllers are responsible for implementing the specific instructions of each TMI."
"Collaborative Decision Making (CDM)","Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) is a joint government/industry initiative aimed at improving air traffic flow management through information sharing. Airlines share their flight schedules and operational needs, and the FAA shares system status and constraints. This collaboration allows for more efficient and equitable traffic management solutions."
"FAAO 7110.65 3-10-5","Helicopter operations require special handling. Helicopters can take off and land from non-runway locations (helipads, taxiways) and can perform air taxiing (flying low and slow). Controllers must be aware of the helicopter's downwash, which can be a hazard to other aircraft, vehicles, and personnel on the ground."
"AIM 7-5-10","Gliders and balloons have the right-of-way over all other engine-driven aircraft. Controllers should provide traffic advisories to aircraft operating near known glider or balloon activity. These aircraft are often unpredictable in their flight path and may not be equipped with transponders, requiring extra vigilance."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-14","Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or drones are an increasing part of the airspace. Controllers must be aware of any approved UAS operations in their sector. A primary concern is a 'lost link' event, where the UAS may follow a pre-programmed contingency route. The controller's priority is to ensure separation between the UAS and all manned aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-13","A standard formation flight is treated as a single aircraft for separation purposes. The lead pilot is responsible for separation within the formation. For non-standard formations (more than 1 mile wide or long), the controller must apply separation to the entire perimeter of the formation as if it were one large aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-4-1","For an air show, a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is established, and control of the participating aircraft is typically handed over to an 'Air Boss.' The ATC controller's role is to ensure no unauthorized aircraft enter the TFR and to manage the traffic flow into and out of the airport before and after the event."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-3","When parachute operations are in effect, the controller must issue advisories on all appropriate frequencies. The advisory should include the location of the jump zone and the altitudes the jumpers will be exiting. The airspace around the jump zone should be considered hazardous for non-participating aircraft."
"FAAO 7110.65 9-2-4","Banner towing operations are typically conducted at low altitudes in VFR conditions. The controller must be aware of the banner tow aircraft's pickup and drop zones. These aircraft are slow-moving and have limited maneuverability, so other traffic should be vectored to avoid them."
"Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)","CPDLC allows for text-based communication between controllers and pilots for non-urgent messages like clearances and reports. This reduces frequency congestion and communication errors. A controller can send a clearance, and the pilot can accept it with a single button press, which automatically loads the clearance into the aircraft's flight management system."
"Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)","ADS-B is a surveillance technology where an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked. It provides more accurate and frequent position updates than traditional radar, allowing for reduced separation minima and more efficient routing."
"Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS)","The Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) is the primary computer system used by the FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) to manage national air traffic flow. It is the tool that implements and monitors all TMIs, such as GDPs and AFPs."
"Electronic Flight Strips (EFS)","Electronic Flight Strips (EFS) are replacing traditional paper strips in many ATC facilities. They automate many tasks, such as updating altitude information and coordinating handoffs. This reduces controller workload and the potential for manual errors, allowing more time for scanning and traffic management."
"Precision Runway Monitor (PRM)","Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) is a high-update radar system that allows for simultaneous independent approaches to parallel runways with centerlines as close as 3,400 feet. A dedicated PRM controller monitors the No Transgression Zone (NTZ) between the runways and will issue immediate breakout instructions if an aircraft deviates from its course."
"Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS)","An EFVS allows a pilot to see an infrared or sensor-based image of the outside world on their head-up display. This can enable a pilot to see the runway environment in low visibility conditions. Under specific regulations, a pilot using EFVS may be able to descend below the normal DA/MDA and land, even if they cannot see the runway with their natural vision."
"FAAO 7210.3","An operational error is an occurrence where a controller fails to apply a prescribed separation standard between aircraft, or between an aircraft and terrain or obstructions. All operational errors are investigated to determine the cause and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence."
"Performance Measurement","ATC facility performance is measured by a variety of metrics, including operational error rates, runway incursion rates, efficiency (e.g., aircraft handled per hour), and compliance with traffic management initiatives. These metrics are used to identify trends and areas for improvement."
"Safety Management System (SMS)","SMS is a formal, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk. It has four components: Safety Policy, Safety Risk Management, Safety Assurance, and Safety Promotion. The goal of SMS is to proactively identify and mitigate hazards before they result in an accident or incident."
"Risk Assessment Procedures","Before a new procedure or piece of equipment is implemented, it must undergo a formal risk assessment. This process identifies potential hazards, analyzes the severity and likelihood of those hazards, and develops mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to an acceptable level."
"Air Traffic Safety Action Program (ATSAP)","ATSAP is a voluntary, confidential safety reporting program that allows controllers to report safety concerns and incidents without fear of disciplinary action. The goal is to collect safety data to identify and fix systemic problems, rather than to assign blame."
"Facility Quality Assurance","Each major ATC facility has a Quality Assurance (QA) department. The QA staff reviews procedures, investigates incidents, monitors performance metrics, and ensures that the facility is in compliance with all national and local directives. They are a key component of the facility's SMS."
"Controller Fatigue Management","Fatigue is a significant risk factor in ATC. The FAA has strict rules on controller scheduling, including maximum hours per shift and minimum time off between shifts. Controllers are also trained to recognize the symptoms of fatigue in themselves and their colleagues and are encouraged to take breaks when needed."
"14 CFR Part 91","Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations contains the general operating and flight rules for all aircraft within the United States. This includes rules for VFR/IFR flight, airspace, and aircraft maintenance. Controllers must have a strong working knowledge of Part 91 as it governs the actions of most pilots they will encounter."
"14 CFR Part 121","Part 121 governs the operations of scheduled air carriers (i.e., major airlines). These operations are held to the highest standards of safety, with strict requirements for pilot training, aircraft maintenance, and dispatch procedures. Controllers can expect Part 121 aircraft to be professionally flown and well-equipped."
"14 CFR Part 135","Part 135 governs on-demand and charter operations, including air taxi, cargo, and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) flights. These operations have slightly different rules than Part 121 but are still held to a high safety standard. A Part 135 MEDEVAC flight has priority handling from ATC."
"14 CFR Part 125","Part 125 governs the operation of large private aircraft (20 or more seats, or a max payload of 6,000 lbs or more) that are not engaged in common carriage. These are often corporate shuttles or large private jets. They are subject to specific safety and maintenance regulations."
"ICAO Annexes","The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) publishes 19 Annexes to the Chicago Convention, which set the international standards for everything from Rules of the Air (Annex 2) to Search and Rescue (Annex 12). Controllers involved in international operations must be aware of the ICAO standards and the specific differences filed by each country."
"FAAO 7110.65 10-2-7","Environmental procedures in ATC often relate to minimizing the impact of aviation on the environment. This includes using designated fuel dumping areas to prevent ground contamination and following noise abatement procedures to reduce the impact on communities near airports."
"Noise Abatement Compliance","Controllers are responsible for applying their facility's noise abatement procedures. This can include assigning preferential runways (directing traffic over less populated areas), issuing specific departure headings, or restricting late-night operations. A pilot can refuse a noise abatement instruction for safety reasons."
"Traffic Management: Reroute Phraseology","When issuing a complex reroute, the controller should first state 'I have an amendment to your route, advise when ready to copy.' This gives the pilot time to prepare. The controller should then read the new route slowly and clearly, and obtain a full readback to ensure accuracy."
"Specialized Ops: Helicopter Air Taxiing","When a helicopter is cleared to 'air taxi,' it is authorized to fly forward in ground effect, typically at speeds below 20 knots and at low altitude. This is different from 'hover taxiing,' which is for slow, sideways, or rearward movements. The controller must ensure the air taxi route is clear of obstacles and other traffic."
"Advanced Tech: ADS-B In","While ADS-B Out broadcasts an aircraft's position, ADS-B In allows an aircraft to receive the broadcasts from other aircraft. This gives the pilot a traffic display in the cockpit, similar to what the controller sees. This technology enhances situational awareness and is a key component of future air traffic concepts."
"QA: Operational Deviation","An operational deviation is similar to an operational error but refers to a situation where an aircraft enters airspace without authorization, such as a VFR aircraft entering Class B airspace without a clearance. The event is investigated to determine if a controller error contributed to the deviation."
"Regulatory: Part 91 Subpart K","Part 91, Subpart K, contains specific rules for fractional ownership programs. These programs allow multiple owners to share access to an aircraft. These flights are often operated like a professional charter service and are held to a higher standard of maintenance and pilot training than standard Part 91 operations."
"Flow Control: Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP)","CTOP is a traffic management initiative that allows airlines to choose from a set of pre-defined alternative routes when their original flight plan is constrained by weather. This collaborative approach gives airlines more flexibility and helps to reduce delays."
"Specialized Ops: Formation Flight Break-up","When a formation flight intends to split into individual aircraft, the lead pilot must coordinate this with the controller. The controller will issue separate clearances and transponder codes to each element of the formation and must ensure that standard separation is applied between the individual aircraft after the break-up is complete."
"Advanced Tech: PRM Breakout Instruction","The phraseology for a PRM breakout is highly specific and must be read verbatim: '[Call sign] turn [left/right] immediately, heading [degrees], climb and maintain [altitude].' There is no room for deviation from this phraseology, as it is designed for immediate pilot recognition and response in a critical situation."
"QA: Mandatory Occurrence Reporting","Many aviation authorities have a Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme, which requires controllers and pilots to report specific types of safety incidents, such as a runway incursion or a loss of separation. This data is used to identify safety trends and mitigate risks across the entire system."
"Regulatory: Part 139","Part 139 certifies airports that serve scheduled air carrier operations. It sets standards for runway maintenance, marking, lighting, and Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) services. A controller at a Part 139 airport can be confident that the airport infrastructure meets a high safety standard."
"Flow Control: Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT)","An EDCT is not a target time; it is a 'no earlier than' time. Pilots are expected to be ready to depart at their EDCT, but the actual takeoff time may be slightly later due to local airport conditions. The goal is to have the aircraft push back from the gate in time to meet the EDCT."
"Specialized Ops: Glider Tow Operations","When a glider is being towed by another aircraft, the combination is treated as a single unit with limited maneuverability. The controller must be aware of the planned release point and altitude. After release, the controller must track two separate aircraft, one of which (the glider) will be unpowered and may not have a transponder."
"Advanced Tech: System Wide Information Management (SWIM)","SWIM is the FAA's digital data-sharing backbone. It allows different systems (ATC, airlines, weather) to share real-time information seamlessly. This is the technology that enables advanced concepts like CDM and TBFM."
"QA: Controller Peer Support Programs","Many facilities have peer support programs where controllers can confidentially discuss stressful events with trained colleagues. This is a key part of fatigue and stress management, helping controllers to cope with the pressures of the job in a healthy way."
"Regulatory: Environmental Impact Statements","Before a major new procedure can be implemented (e.g., a new arrival route over a populated area), the FAA may be required to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This process assesses the potential noise and environmental effects and allows for public comment."
"Flow Control: Ground Stop (GS)","A Ground Stop is the most restrictive traffic management initiative. It halts all departures to a specific airport. A GS is typically implemented for a short duration to allow the destination airport to recover from a sudden event, such as a closed runway or a severe, unforecasted weather cell."
"Specialized Ops: UAS Lost Link Phraseology","If a UAS pilot reports a lost link, the controller should ask for the expected lost link profile. Phraseology: 'Nighthawk 1, roger, lost link. What is your expected lost link procedure?' The controller must then broadcast an advisory to all other aircraft about the uncrewed aircraft and its expected behavior."
"Advanced Tech: Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)","Pilots now use Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs), typically iPads, to carry all their charts and manuals. This means they have immediate access to all procedures, but it also means the controller cannot assume the pilot has a paper chart laid out in front of them. Clear communication of procedure names and transitions is essential."
"QA: Trend Analysis","Quality Assurance departments perform trend analysis on safety data. For example, if they notice a pattern of runway incursions at a specific intersection, they can initiate a study to determine the cause (e.g., confusing signage, poor lighting) and recommend a solution. This is a proactive approach to safety."
"Regulatory: ICAO Annex 2","ICAO Annex 2, 'Rules of the Air,' is the international equivalent of the U.S. Part 91. It establishes the fundamental flight rules that are recognized globally, such as the right-of-way rules and VFR weather minimums. While similar to Part 91, there are subtle but important differences."
"Flow Control: Playbook Route Activation","When a playbook route is activated, it will be disseminated via an FAA advisory. The advisory will specify which flights are affected (e.g., 'all departures from ZNY to ZTL') and the new, required route. Controllers must then issue this reroute to all applicable aircraft."
"Specialized Ops: Air Show 'Air Boss'","The Air Boss is the individual responsible for all aerial activity within the air show TFR. They are in direct communication with the performers and are the final authority on safety within the show box. The ATC controller coordinates with the Air Boss to manage traffic outside the TFR but does not control the performers."
"Advanced Tech: Data Comm","Data Comm is the FAA's implementation of CPDLC in the terminal and en route environments. It allows for the digital transmission of departure clearances, revised routes, and other instructions. This greatly reduces frequency congestion and improves efficiency, especially at busy airports."
"QA: Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS)","An FRMS is a more advanced approach than simple hour-based rules. It uses scientific principles to actively manage fatigue risk. This can include predictive models to identify fatiguing schedules and allowing controllers to submit fatigue reports without penalty to help identify and mitigate risks."
"Regulatory: Noise Abatement Departure Profile (NADP)","An NADP is a specific vertical profile an aircraft flies after takeoff to reduce noise on the ground. There are two main types: one prioritizes gaining altitude quickly, while the other prioritizes reducing thrust quickly. The specific NADP used depends on the airport and the surrounding community."
"IVAO US-DIV Policy 1.1","All air traffic control services within the IVAO US Division are based on the current version of FAA Order JO 7110.65. All members controlling in the US Division are expected to be familiar with and apply these procedures. [1, 3] Where IVAO global rules conflict with FAA procedures, the FAA procedures generally take precedence unless a specific IVAO US-DIV waiver is documented. [1]"
"IVAO US-DIV Training SOP 2.1","The US Division utilizes the standard IVAO ATC rating progression: Aerodrome Student (AS1/AS2), Aerodrome Controller (AS3/ADC), Approach Controller (APC), and Center Controller (ACC). The Senior Controller (SEC) rating is not required for any position within the US Division. [1, 14]"
"IVAO US-DIV Training SOP 4.1","Progression from AS1 to AS2 is automatic after a member completes 10 hours of online controlling time. However, to control unsupervised, a new member must first request 'First Steps & Ground Training' from the division's training department and complete initial supervised sessions at an assigned training airport. [1, 20]"
"IVAO US-DIV Policy 2.3","Facility Rating Assignments (FRAs) dictate the minimum ATC rating required to control a specific position. For example, a busy approach control like New York (N90) will require an APC rating, while a quiet regional tower may only require an AS3. Members can view the FRA for any position on the division website. [1, 20]"
"IVAO US-DIV Training SOP 4.2","To advance from AS2 to AS3, a trainee must complete a total of 25 hours of controlling time, be registered on the network for more than 14 days, and successfully pass the AS3 theoretical exam. [1, 14] This rating allows the member to control any Delivery, Ground, or Tower position not otherwise restricted by an FRA. [1]"
"IVAO US-DIV Training SOP 1.1","The US Division training philosophy is based on self-study combined with practical guidance. Students are expected to study the FAA 7110.65, the US Division ATC Syllabus, and local SOPs on their own. Training sessions with instructors are for demonstrating skills, pointing out mistakes, and providing guidance, not for full lectures. [1]"
"IVAO US-DIV QA Procedure 1.1","The Quality Assurance department monitors controller performance to ensure a high standard of service. This may involve live monitoring of controlling sessions or reviewing logs. The goal is not punitive but educational, to identify areas for improvement and ensure compliance with procedures."
"IVAO US-DIV Policy 3.1","All members are expected to maintain a professional and respectful demeanor at all times. Harassment, offensive language, or simulation of real-world conflicts is strictly prohibited. Violations can lead to suspension by a supervisor and further disciplinary action by division staff. [15]"
"IVAO US-DIV Policy 4.1","To maintain an active status, controllers are generally expected to log on and control for a minimum number of hours per quarter. [VERIFY WITH CURRENT US-DIV WIKI] While IVAO global rules require logging on once every three months to keep an account active, divisions may have their own activity policies for staff and rated controllers. [10, 15]"
"IVAO US-DIV Event SOP 2.1","Members wishing to control during major divisional events, such as 'Real Flight Operations' (RFO), must bid for a position via the event's booking system. Selection is based on factors including rating, experience, past event participation, and overall activity, to give everyone a fair chance. [13]"
"IVAO US-DIV Admin 1.1","The official communication channels for the US Division include the division website (wiki.us.ivao.aero), the official forum, and the official division Discord server. The Discord server is used for real-time coordination between active controllers and for general community discussion. [2, 13]"
"IVAO US-DIV Training SOP 5.1","Practical exams for ADC, APC, and ACC ratings are conducted by authorized trainers. The exam will simulate a realistic traffic scenario designed to test the candidate's knowledge of procedures, phraseology, and ability to manage workload and non-standard situations for the rating being tested."
"IVAO US-DIV Policy 5.1","Exam integrity is taken very seriously. Any form of cheating on theoretical or practical exams will result in immediate failure and may lead to further disciplinary action, including suspension from the network. All exams must be conducted through the official IVAO systems. [10]"
"IVAO US-DIV LOA ZNY-ZBW","A Letter of Agreement exists between New York ARTCC (ZNY) and Boston ARTCC (ZBW) defining the procedures for handoffs on specific airways. For example, traffic on J48 northbound is transferred from ZNY to ZBW at a specific fix and altitude, with automated handoffs being the standard procedure. [VERIFY WITH CURRENT US-DIV WIKI]"
"IVAO US-DIV Facility SOP ZLA 1.1","Los Angeles ARTCC (KZLA) has specific procedures for managing the complex airspace, including defined arrival gates for LAX traffic and procedures for coordinating with SoCal TRACON (SCT). Controllers must review the ZLA SOP before controlling this airspace. [VERIFY WITH CURRENT US-DIV WIKI]"
"IVAO US-DIV Training SOP 6.1","Remedial training is mandatory training assigned to a controller who has demonstrated deficiencies in a specific area. The Training Coordinator (TC) is responsible for assigning and overseeing remedial training, which must be completed before the controller can resume normal duties. [1]"
"IVAO US-DIV Policy 3.2","A 'stuck microphone' on the frequency is a serious issue. If a controller experiences this, they should immediately disconnect and reconnect. If the problem persists, they must log off and seek technical help. Continuing to block a frequency is a disservice to the network."
"IVAO US-DIV Event SOP 3.1","During large-scale events, a specific 'event channel' on the Discord server is often used for ATC-to-ATC coordination. This keeps the main frequencies clear for pilot communication and allows for rapid coordination of reroutes, holding, and special instructions."
"IVAO US-DIV QA Procedure 2.1","Incident reporting is a key part of the quality assurance system.
