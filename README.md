## 📖 Overview  

The **IVAO US Division – FAA ATC AI Assistant** is a **work-in-progress project** that uses **Gemini AI** to help IVAO ATC students and trainees learn FAA procedures.  

It provides:  
- Answers to **ATC-related questions** using **official FAA documentation** (FAA JO 7110.65, AIM, FAA Handbooks).  
- A study companion for **IVAO ATC ratings** (ADC, APC, etc.).  
- Quick references to **phraseology, separation minima, and airspace rules**.  

> 🛠️ **Note:** This project is under active development and not yet deployed.

This chatbot is for **educational and simulation use only** within the IVAO community.  

- It must **NOT** be used as a source for **real-world ATC or aviation operations**.  
- Always consult the **official FAA publications** directly for real-world training or operations.
