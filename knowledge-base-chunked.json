    "content": "Standard Operating Practice (SOP) for the Transfer of Position Responsibility\nAppendix A. Standard Operating Practice (SOP) for the Transfer of Position Responsibility\nPURPOSEThis appendix prescribes the method and step-by-step process for conducting a position relief briefing and transferring position responsibility from one specialist to another.\nDISCUSSIONIn all operational facilities, the increase in traffic density and the need for the expeditious movement of traffic without compromising safety have emphasized the importance of the position relief process.The contents, methods, and practices used for position relief and briefings vary among personnel, and pertinent information is often forgotten or incompletely covered. Major problems occur whenever there is a heavy reliance upon memory, unsupported by routines or systematic reminders. This SOP addresses the complete task of transferring position responsibility and the associated relief briefing.Position relief unavoidably provides workload for specialists at the time of relief. The intent of this SOP is to make the transfer of position responsibility take place smoothly and to ensure a complete transfer of information with a minimum amount of workload. The method takes advantage of a self-briefing concept in which the relieving specialist obtains needed status information by reading from the Status Information Area/s to begin the relief process. Up to the moment information related to the control of aircraft or vehicular movements requires verbal exchanges between specialists during the relief process. The method also specifies the moment when the transfer of position responsibility occurs.In the final part of the relief process, the specialist being relieved monitors and reviews the position to ensure that nothing has been overlooked or incorrectly displayed and that the transfer of position responsibility occurred with a complete briefing.TERMSThe following terms are important for a complete understanding of this SOP:\nStatus Information Area (SIA). Manual or automatic displays of the current status of position related equipment and operational conditions or procedures.Written Notes. Manually recorded items of information kept at designated locations on the position of operation. They may be an element of the Status Information Area/s.Checklist. An ordered listing of items to be covered during a position relief.PRECAUTIONSSpecialists involved in the position relief process should not rush or be influenced to rush.During position operation, each item of status information which is or may be an operational factor for the relieving specialist should be recorded as soon as it is operationally feasible so that it will not be forgotten or incorrectly recorded.Extra care should be taken when more than one specialist relieves or is being relieved from a position at the same time; e.g., combining or decombining positions. Such simultaneous reliefs should be approached with caution.RESPONSIBILITIESThe specialist being relieved must be responsible for ensuring that any pertinent status information of which he/she is aware is relayed to the relieving specialist and is either:Accurately displayed in the Status Information Area/s for which he/she has responsibility, orRelayed to the position having responsibility for accurately displaying the status information.The relieving specialist must be responsible for ensuring that, prior to accepting responsibility for the position, any unresolved questions pertaining to the operation of the position are resolved.The relieving specialist and the specialist being relieved must share equal responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the position relief briefing.The specialists engaged in a position relief must conduct the relief process at the position being relieved unless other procedures have been established and authorized by the facility air traffic manager.NOTE-\nThe “sharing” of this responsibility means that the specialist being relieved is obligated to provide a complete, accurate briefing and the relieving specialist is obligated to ensure that a briefing takes place and is to his/her total satisfaction.\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCESSPREVIEW THE POSITION\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Follow checklist and review the Status Information Area(s).\nNOTE-\nThis sub‐step may be replaced by an authorized pre-position briefing provided an equivalent review of checklist items is accomplished.\n2. Observe position equipment, operational situation, and the work environment.\n3. Listen to voice communications and observe other operational actions.\n4. Observe current and pending aircraft and vehicular traffic and correlate with flight and other movement information.\n5. Indicate to the specialist being relieved that the position has been previewed and that the verbal briefing may begin.\nNOTE-\nSubsteps 6a2, 3, and 4 may be conducted concurrently or in any order.\nVERBAL BRIEFING\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Brief the relieving specialist on the abnormal status of items not listed on the Status Information Area(s) as well as on any items of special interest calling for verbal explanation or additional discussion.\n2. Brief on reported weather and other weather related information.\n3. Brief on traffic if applicable.\n4. Brief communication status of all known aircraft except for ERAM facilities using Voice Communication Indicator (VCI).\n5. Ask questions necessary to ensure a complete understanding of the operational situation.\n6. Completely answer any questions asked.\nASSUMPTION OF POSITION RESPONSIBILITY\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Make a statement or otherwise indicate to the specialist being relieved that position responsibility has been assumed.\n2. Release the position to the relieving specialist and mentally note the time.\nREVIEW THE POSITION\nRelieving Specialist\nSpecialist Being Relieved\n1. Check, verify, and update the information obtained in steps 6a and b.\n2. Check position equipment in accordance with existing directives.\n3. Review checklist, Status Information Area/s, written notes, and other prescribed sources of information and advise the relieving specialist of known omissions, updates, or inaccuracies.\n4. Observe overall position operation to determine if assistance is needed.\n5. If assistance is needed, provide or summon it as appropriate.\n6. Advise the appropriate position regarding known Status Information Area(s) omissions, updates, or inaccuracies.\n7. Sign‐on the relieving specialist with the time as noted in step 6c2.\n8. Sign off the position in accordance with existing directives or otherwise indicate that the relief process is complete.",

    "content": "EmergenciesEmergency Assistance\nSection 2. Emergency AssistanceINFORMATION REQUIREMENTS\nStart assistance as soon as enough information has been obtained upon which to act. Information requirements will vary, depending on the existing situation. Minimum required information for inflight emergencies is:\nNOTE-\nIn the event of an ELT signal see paragraph 10-2-10, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.\nAircraft identification and type.\nNature of the emergency.\nPilot's desires.\nAfter initiating action, obtain the following items or any other pertinent information from the pilot or aircraft operator, as necessary:\nNOTE-\nEmergency Autoland systems may not provide all of the required information for emergencies. Use the information provided to develop an appropriate course of action to assist the aircraft.\nIf an emergency has been declared by an Emergency Autoland system, transmissions to the aircraft may go unanswered.\nNormally, do not request this information from military fighter-type aircraft that are at low altitudes (for example, on approach, immediately after departure, on a low level route). However, request the position of an aircraft that is not visually sighted or displayed on radar if the location is not given by the pilot.\nAircraft altitude.\nFuel remaining in time.\nPilot reported weather.\nPilot capability for IFR flight.\nTime and place of last known position.\nHeading since last known position.\nAirspeed.\nNavigation equipment capability.\nNAVAID signals received.\nVisible landmarks.\nAircraft color.\nNumber of people on board.\nPoint of departure and destination.\nEmergency equipment on board.\nFREQUENCY CHANGES\nAlthough 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz are emergency frequencies, it might be best to keep the aircraft on the initial contact frequency. Change frequencies only when there is a valid reason.\nAIRCRAFT ORIENTATION\nOrientate an aircraft by the means most appropriate to the circumstances. Recognized methods include:\nRadar.\nNAVAIDs.\nPilotage.\nSighting by other aircraft.\nALTITUDE CHANGE FOR IMPROVED RECEPTION\nWhen you consider it necessary and if weather and circumstances permit, recommend that the aircraft maintain or increase altitude to improve communications or radar.\nNOTE-\nAircraft with high‐bypass turbofan engines (such as B747) encountering volcanic ash clouds have experienced total loss of power to all engines. Damage to engines due to volcanic ash ingestion increases as engine power is increased, therefore, climb while in the ash cloud is to be avoided where terrain permits.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 7-5-9, Flight Operations in Volcanic Ash.\nEMERGENCY SITUATIONS\nConsider that an aircraft emergency exists and inform the RCC or ARTCC if:\nNOTE-\nUSAF facilities are only required to notify the ARTCC.\nAn emergency is declared by any of the following:\nThe pilot.\nFacility personnel.\nOfficials responsible for the operation of the aircraft.\nA system-generated transmission from an aircraft.\nThere is unexpected loss of radar contact and radio communications with any IFR or VFR aircraft.\nReports indicate it has made a forced landing, is about to do so, or its operating efficiency is so impaired that a forced landing will be necessary.\nReports indicate the crew has abandoned the aircraft or is about to do so.\nAn emergency transponder code is displayed or reported.\nNOTE-\nEN ROUTE. ERAM: Code 7700 causes an emergency indicator to blink in the data block.\nIntercept or escort aircraft services are required.\nThe need for ground rescue appears likely.\nAn Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) signal is heard or reported.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-3, Providing Assistance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-10, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.\nHIJACKED AIRCRAFT\nHijack attempts or actual events are a matter of national security and require special handling. FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations, describes additional procedures and reporting requirements that must be followed.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Chapter 7, Procedures for Handling Suspicious Flight Situations and Hijacked Aircraft.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-11, Code Monitor.\nWhen a pilot notifies ATC verbally of a hijacking situation, assign code 7500 to the subject aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification) SQUAWK SEVEN FIVE ZERO ZERO.\nShould the pilot acknowledge assignment of code 7500 without further communication, or fail to acknowledge or communicate further, assume that the flight is being subject to hijack.\nNo reference to the hijacking must be made in subsequent communications unless initiated by the pilot, or unless directed by the Domestic Events Network (DEN) Air Traffic Security Coordinator.\nImmediately inform the operations manager, supervisor or CIC.\nNOTE-\nWhen an aircraft squawks code 7500, ERAM will display “HIJK,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “HJ” in the data block.\nWhen a pilot notifies ATC of a hijacking situation by squawking code 7500, use the following phraseology to verify that the aircrew intentionally selected code 7500.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification)(name of facility) VERIFY SQUAWKING SEVEN FIVE ZERO ZERO.\nShould the pilot fail to acknowledge or communicate further, assume that the flight is being subject to hijack.\nNo reference to the hijacking must be made in subsequent communications unless initiated by the pilot, or unless directed by the DEN Air Traffic Security Coordinator.\nImmediately inform the operations manager, supervisor or CIC.\nVFR AIRCRAFT IN WEATHER DIFFICULTY\nIf VFR aircraft requests assistance when it encounters or is about to encounter IFR weather conditions, determine the facility best able to provide service. If a frequency change is necessary, advise the pilot of the reason for the change, and request the aircraft contact the appropriate control facility. Inform that facility of the situation. If the aircraft is unable to communicate with the control facility, relay information and clearances.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nRADAR ASSISTANCE TO VFR AIRCRAFT IN WEATHER DIFFICULTY\nIf a VFR aircraft requests radar assistance when it encounters or is about to encounter IFR weather conditions, ask the pilot if he/she is qualified for and capable of conducting IFR flight.\nIf the pilot states he/she is qualified for and capable of IFR flight, request him/her to file an IFR flight plan and then issue clearance to destination airport, as appropriate.\nIf the pilot states he/she is not qualified for or not capable of conducting IFR flight, or if he/she refuses to file an IFR flight plan, take whichever of the following actions is appropriate:\nInform the pilot of airports where VFR conditions are reported, provide other available pertinent weather information, and ask if he/she will elect to conduct VFR flight to such an airport.\nIf the action in subparagraph 1 above is not feasible or the pilot declines to conduct VFR flight to another airport, provide radar assistance if the pilot:\nDeclares an emergency.\nRefuses to declare an emergency and you have determined the exact nature of the radar services the pilot desires.\nIf the aircraft has already encountered IFR conditions, inform the pilot of the appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude. If the aircraft is below appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude and sufficiently accurate position information has been received or radar identification is established, furnish a heading or radial on which to climb to reach appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nRADAR ASSISTANCE TECHNIQUES\nUse the following techniques to the extent possible when you provide radar assistance to a pilot not qualified to operate in IFR conditions:\nAvoid radio frequency changes except when necessary to provide a clear communications channel.\nMake turns while the aircraft is in VFR conditions so it will be in a position to fly a straight course while in IFR conditions.\nHave pilot lower gear and slow aircraft to approach speed while in VFR conditions.\nAvoid requiring a climb or descent while in a turn if in IFR conditions.\nAvoid abrupt maneuvers.\nVector aircraft to VFR conditions.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nEMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER (ELT) SIGNALS\nWhen an ELT signal is heard or reported:\nEN ROUTE. Notify the Rescue Coordination Center (RCC).\nNOTE-\nFAA Form 7210-8, ELT INCIDENT, contains standardized format for coordination with the RCC.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 9-3-1, FAA Form 7210-8, ELT Incident.\nTERMINAL. Notify the ARTCC which will coordinate with the RCC.\nNOTE-\nOperational ground testing of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) has been authorized during the first 5 minutes of each hour. To avoid confusing the tests with an actual alarm, the testing is restricted to no more than three audio sweeps.\nControllers can expect pilots to report aircraft position and time the signal was first heard, aircraft position and time the signal was last heard, aircraft position at maximum signal strength, flight altitude, and frequency of the emergency signal (121.5/243.0). (See AIM, paragraph 6-2-4, Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT).)\nTERMINAL. Attempt to obtain fixes or bearings on the signal.\nSolicit the assistance of other aircraft known to be operating in the signal area.\nTERMINAL. Forward fixes or bearings and any other pertinent information to the ARTCC.\nNOTE-\nFix information in relation to a VOR or VORTAC (radial‐ distance) facilitates accurate ELT plotting by RCC and should be provided when possible.\nEN ROUTE. When the ELT signal strength indicates the signal may be emanating from somewhere on an airport or vicinity thereof, notify the on‐site technical operations personnel and the Regional Operations Center (ROC) for their actions. This action is in addition to the above.\nTERMINAL. When the ELT signal strength indicates the signal may be emanating from somewhere on the airport or vicinity thereof, notify the on‐site technical operations personnel and the ARTCC for their action. This action is in addition to the above.\nAir traffic personnel must not leave their required duty stations to locate an ELT signal source.\nNOTE-\nPortable handcarried receivers assigned to air traffic facilities (where no technical operations personnel are available) may be loaned to responsible airport personnel or local authorities to assist in locating the ELT signal source.\nEN ROUTE.

If the threat is general in nature, handle it as a “Suspicious Activity.” When the threat is targeted against a specific aircraft and you are in contact with the suspect aircraft, take the following actions as appropriate:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Chapter 7, Procedures for Handling Suspicious Flight Situations and Hijacked Aircraft.\nAdvise the pilot of the threat.\nInform the pilot that technical assistance can be obtained from an FAA aviation explosives expert.\nNOTE-\nAn FAA aviation explosive expert is on call at all times and may be contacted by calling the FAA Operations Center, Washington, DC, Area Code 202-267-3333, ETN 521-0111, or DSN 851-3750. Technical advice can be relayed to assist civil or military air crews in their search for a bomb and in determining what precautionary action to take if one is found.\nAsk the pilot if he/she desires to climb or descend to an altitude that would equalize or reduce the outside air pressure/existing cabin air pressure differential. Issue or relay an appropriate clearance considering MEA, MOCA, MRA, and weather.\nNOTE-\nEqualizing existing cabin air pressure with outside air pressure is a key step which the pilot may wish to take to minimize the damage potential of a bomb.\nHandle the aircraft as an emergency and/or provide the most expeditious handling possible with respect to the safety of other aircraft, ground facilities, and personnel.\nNOTE-\nEmergency handling is discretionary and should be based on the situation. With certain types of threats, plans may call for a low‐key action or response.\nIssue or relay clearances to a new destination if requested.\nWhen a pilot requests technical assistance or if it is apparent that a pilot may need such assistance, do NOT suggest what actions the pilot should take concerning a bomb, but obtain the following information and notify your supervisor who will contact the FAA aviation explosives expert:\nNOTE-\nThis information is needed by the FAA aviation explosives expert so that he/she can assess the situation and make immediate recommendations to the pilot. The aviation explosives expert may not be familiar with all military aircraft configurations but he/she can offer technical assistance which would be beneficial to the pilot.\nType, series, and model of the aircraft.\nPrecise location/description of the bomb device if known.\nOther details which may be pertinent.\nNOTE-\nThe following details may be of significance if known, but it is not intended that the pilot should disturb a suspected bomb/bomb container to ascertain the information: The altitude or time set for the bomb to explode, type of detonating action (barometric, time, anti‐handling, remote radio transmitter), power source (battery, electrical, mechanical), type of initiator (blasting cap, flash bulb, chemical), and the type of explosive/incendiary charge (dynamite, black powder, chemical).\nWhen a bomb threat involves an aircraft on the ground and you are in contact with the suspect aircraft, take the following actions in addition to those discussed in the preceding paragraphs which may be appropriate:\nIf the aircraft is at an airport where tower control or FSS advisory service is not available, or if the pilot ignores the threat at any airport, recommend that takeoff be delayed until the pilot or aircraft operator establishes that a bomb is not aboard in accordance with 14 CFR part 121. If the pilot insists on taking off and in your opinion the operation will not adversely affect other traffic, issue or relay an ATC clearance.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR Section 121.538, Airplane Security.\nAdvise the aircraft to remain as far away from other aircraft and facilities as possible, to clear the runway, if appropriate, and to taxi to an isolated or designated search area. When it is impractical or if the pilot takes an alternative action; e.g., parking and off‐loading immediately, advise other aircraft to remain clear of the suspect aircraft by at least 100 yards if able.\nNOTE-\nPassenger deplaning may be of paramount importance and must be considered before the aircraft is parked or moved away from service areas. The decision to use ramp facilities rests with the pilot, aircraft operator/airport manager.\nIf you are unable to inform the suspect aircraft of a bomb threat or if you lose contact with the aircraft, advise your supervisor and relay pertinent details to other sectors or facilities as deemed necessary.\nWhen a pilot reports the discovery of a bomb or suspected bomb on an aircraft which is airborne or on the ground, determine the pilot's intentions and comply with his/her requests in so far as possible. Take all of the actions discussed in the preceding paragraphs which may be appropriate under the existing circumstances.\nThe handling of aircraft when a hijacker has or is suspected of having a bomb requires special considerations. Be responsive to the pilot's requests and notify supervisory personnel. Apply hijacking procedures and offer assistance to the pilot according to the preceding paragraphs, if needed.\nEXPLOSIVE DETECTION K-9 TEAMS\nTake the following actions should you receive an aircraft request for the location of the nearest explosive detection K-9 team.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-12, Explosives Detection K-9 Teams.\nObtain the aircraft identification and position and advise your supervisor of the pilot request.\nWhen you receive the nearest location of the explosive detection K-9 team, relay the information to the pilot.\nIf the aircraft wishes to divert to the airport location provided, obtain an estimated arrival time from the pilot and advise your supervisor.\nMANPADS ALERT\nWhen a threat or attack from Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) is determined to be real, notify and advise aircraft as follows:\nDo not withhold landing clearance. To the extent possible, issue information on MANPADS threats, confirmed attacks, or post-event activities in time for it to be useful to the pilot. The pilot or parent company will determine the pilot's actions.\nMANPADS information will be disseminated via the ATIS and/or controller-to-pilot transmissions.\nDisseminate via controller-to-pilot transmission until the appropriate MANPADS information is broadcast via the ATIS and pilots indicate they have received the appropriate ATIS code. MANPADS information will include nature and location of threat or incident, whether reported or observed and by whom, time (if known), and when transmitting to an individual aircraft, a request for pilot's intentions.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATTENTION (aircraft identification), MANPADS ALERT. EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION. MANPADS THREAT/ATTACK/POST-EVENT ACTIVITY OBSERVED/ REPORTED BY (reporting agency) (location) AT (time, if known). (When transmitting to an individual aircraft) SAY INTENTIONS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention Eastern Four Seventeen, MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS threat reported by TSA, LaGuardia vicinity. Say intentions.”\n“Attention all aircraft, MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS post-event activity observed by tower south of airport at two-one-zero-zero Zulu.”\nReport MANPADS threat/attack/post-event activity via the ATIS and/or controller-to-pilot transmissions until notified otherwise by the Domestic Events Network (DEN) Air Traffic Security Coordinator (ATSC).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-10, Handling MANPADS Incidents.\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 3-1-3, Responsibilities.\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION OF AIRCRAFT\nWhen a laser event is reported to an air traffic facility, broadcast on all appropriate frequencies a general caution warning every five minutes for 20 minutes following the last report.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION EVENT, (location), (altitude).\nTerminal facilities must include reported unauthorized laser illumination events on the ATIS broadcast for one hour following the last report. Include the time, location, altitude, color, and direction of the laser as reported by the pilot.\nNOTE-\nAll personnel can expect aircrews to regard lasers as an inflight emergency and may take evasive action to avoid laser illumination. Additionally, other aircraft may request clearance to avoid the area.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-30, Reporting Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\nEMERGENCY AIRPORT RECOMMENDATION\nConsider the following factors when recommending an emergency airport:\nRemaining fuel in relation to airport distances.\nWeather conditions.\nNOTE-\nDepending on the nature of the emergency, certain weather phenomena may deserve weighted consideration when recommending an airport; e.g., a pilot may elect to fly farther to land at an airport with VFR instead of IFR conditions.\nAirport conditions.\nNAVAID status.\nAircraft type.\nPilot's qualifications.\nVectoring or homing capability to the emergency airport.\nNOTE-\nIn the event of an Emergency Autoland system activation, the system will select a suitable airport and advise ATC. The Emergency Autoland system does not consider closed runways, equipment on the runway, construction, or other possible airport hazards when selecting a suitable airport.\nConsideration to the provisions of subparagraph a and paragraph 10-2-16, Guidance to Emergency Airport, must be used in conjunction with the information derived from any automated emergency airport information source.\nGUIDANCE TO EMERGENCY AIRPORT\nWhen necessary, use any of the following for guidance to the airport:\nRadar.\nFollowing another aircraft.\nNAVAIDs.\nPilotage by landmarks.\nCompass headings.\nConsideration to the provisions of paragraph 10-2-15, Emergency Airport Recommendation, must be used in conjunction with the information derived from any automated emergency airport information source.\nEMERGENCY OBSTRUCTION VIDEO MAP (EOVM)\nThe EOVM is intended to facilitate advisory service to an aircraft in an emergency situation wherein an appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude cannot be maintained. It must only be used and the service provided under the following conditions:\nThe pilot has declared an emergency, or\nThe controller has determined that an emergency condition exists or is imminent because of the pilot's inability to maintain an appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude.\nNOTE-\nAppropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitudes may be defined as Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA), Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA), Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA), or Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA).\nWhen providing emergency vectoring service, the controller must advise the pilot that any headings issued are emergency advisories intended only to direct the aircraft toward and over an area of lower terrain/obstacle elevation.\nNOTE-\nAltitudes and obstructions depicted on the EOVM are the actual altitudes and locations of the obstacle/terrain and contain no lateral or vertical buffers for obstruction clearance.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-8-4, Emergency Obstruction Video Map (EOVM).\nVOLCANIC ASH\nIf a volcanic ash cloud is known or forecast to be present:\nRelay all information available to pilots to ensure that they are aware of the ash cloud's position and altitude(s).\nSuggest appropriate reroutes to avoid the area of known or forecast ash clouds.\nNOTE-\nVolcanic ash clouds are not normally detected by airborne or air traffic radar systems.\nIf advised by an aircraft that it has entered a volcanic ash cloud and indicates that a distress situation exists:\nConsider the aircraft to be in an emergency situation.\nDo not initiate any climb clearances to turbine-powered aircraft until the aircraft has exited the ash cloud.\nDo not attempt to provide escape vectors without pilot concurrence.\nNOTE-\nThe recommended escape maneuver is to reverse course and begin a descent (if terrain permits). However, it is the pilot's responsibility to determine the safest escape route from the ash cloud.\nControllers should be aware of the possibility of complete loss of power to any turbine-powered aircraft that encounters an ash cloud.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-4, Altitude Change for Improved Reception.\nAIM, Para 7-5-9, Flight Operations in Volcanic Ash.\nREPORTING DEATH, ILLNESS, OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH RISK ON BOARD AIRCRAFT\nIf an air traffic controller receives a report of the death of person, an illness, and/or other public health risk obtain the following information and notify the operations manager in charge (OMIC)/operations supervisor (OS)/controller-in-charge (CIC) as soon as possible.\nCall sign.\nNumber of suspected cases of illness on board.\nNature of the illnesses or other public health risk, if known.\nNumber of persons on board.\nNumber of deaths, if applicable.\nPilot's intent (for example, continue to destination or divert).\nAny request for assistance (for example, needing emergency medical services to meet the aircraft at arrival).\nThe OMIC/OS/CIC must relay the information to the DEN as soon as possible.\nNOTE-\nIf the ATC facility is not actively monitoring the DEN or does not have a dedicated line to the DEN, they must call into the DEN directly via 844-432-2962 (toll free).\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, such as a situation requiring ATC intervention, follow-on coordination regarding the incident will not involve ATC frequencies.\nThe initial report to a U.S. ATC facility may be passed from a prior ATC facility along the route of flight.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-37, Reporting Death, Illness, or Other Public Health Risk On Board Aircraft.",

    "content": "EmergenciesOceanic Emergency Procedures\nSection 6. Oceanic Emergency ProceduresAPPLICATION\nThe procedures in this section are to be used solely in oceanic airspace.\nPHASES OF EMERGENCY\nEmergency phases are described as follows:\nUncertainty phase (INCERFA). When there is concern about the safety of an aircraft or its occupants, an INCERFA exists:\nWhen communication from an aircraft has not been received within 30 minutes after the time a communication should have been received or after the time an unsuccessful attempt to establish communication with such aircraft was first made, whichever is earlier; or\nWhen an aircraft fails to arrive within 30 minutes after the time of arrival last estimated by the pilot or by the ATC units, whichever is later.\nAlert phase (ALERFA). When there is apprehension about the safety of an aircraft and its occupants, an ALERFA exists:\nFollowing the uncertainty phase when subsequent attempts to establish communications with the aircraft, or inquiries to other relevant sources have failed to reveal any information about the aircraft; or\nWhen information has been received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired but not to the extent that a forced landing is likely; or\nWhen communication from an aircraft has not been received within 60 minutes after the time a communication should have been received or after the time an unsuccessful attempt to establish communication with such aircraft was first made, whichever is earlier.\nDistress phase (DETRESFA). When there is reasonable certainty that the aircraft and its occupants are threatened by grave and imminent danger, a DETRESFA exists:\nFollowing the alert phase when further attempts to establish communications with the aircraft and more widespread inquiries are unsuccessful; or\nWhen the fuel on board is considered to be exhausted or to be insufficient for the aircraft to reach safety; or\nWhen information is received which indicates that the operating efficiency of the aircraft has been impaired to the extent that a forced landing is likely; or\nWhen information is received or it is reasonably certain that the aircraft is about to make or has made a forced landing.\nALERTING SERVICE AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE\nProvide alerting service to:\nAll aircraft receiving ATC service;\nAll other aircraft which have filed a flight plan or which are otherwise known to the ATC unit; and\nAny aircraft known or believed to be the subject of unlawful interference.\nWhen alerting service is required, the responsibility for coordinating such service must, unless otherwise established by letter of agreement, rest with the facility serving the FIR or CTA:\nWithin which the aircraft was flying at the time of last air‐ground radio contact; or\nWhich the aircraft was about to enter if the last air‐ground contact was established at or close to the boundary; or\nWithin which the point of destination is located if the aircraft:\nWas not equipped with suitable two‐way radio communications equipment; or\nWas not under obligation to transmit position reports.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 8, Section 2, Coordination.\nThe responsible Area Control Center (ACC) must serve as the control point for:\nCollecting all information relevant to a state of emergency of an aircraft;\nForwarding that information to the appropriate RCC; and\nCoordinating with other facilities concerned.\nThe responsibility of the ACC to provide alerting service for military aircraft may be waived upon a written or recorded request from a military agency. In this case, the military request must state that the military agency assumes full responsibility for their aircraft while the aircraft are operating in the oceanic airspace.\nResponsibility to provide alerting service for flight operations conducted under the “due regard” or “operational” prerogative of military aircraft is assumed by the military. When “due regard” operations are scheduled to end with aircraft filed under ICAO procedures, the ACC may, if specified in a letter of agreement, assume responsibility for alerting service at proposed time filed.\nIn the event of INCERFA, ALERFA, or DETRESFA, notify the following:\nWhen practicable, the aircraft operator.\nThe appropriate RCC.\nAeronautical stations having en route communications guard responsibilities at the point of departure, along or adjacent to the route of flight, and at the destination.\nACCs having jurisdiction over the proposed route of flight from the last reported position to the destination airport.\nINCERFA, ALERFA, and DETRESFA messages must include the following information, if available, in the order listed:\nINCERFA, ALERFA, or DETRESFA according to the phase of the emergency.\nAgency and person originating the message.\nNature of the emergency.\nSignificant flight plan information.\nThe air traffic unit which made the last radio contact, the time, and the frequency used.\nThe aircraft's last position report, how it was received, and what facility received it.\nColor and distinctive marks of aircraft.\nAny action taken by reporting office.\nOther pertinent remarks.\nAn INCERFA phase ends with the receipt of any information or position report on the aircraft. Cancel the INCERFA by a message addressed to the same stations as the INCERFA message.\nAn ALERFA ends when:\nEvidence exists that would ease apprehension about the safety of the aircraft and its occupants; or\nThe concerned aircraft lands. Cancel the ALERFA message by a message addressed to the same stations as the ALERFA message.\nA DETRESFA ends when the:\nAircraft successfully lands; or\nRCC advises of a successful rescue; or\nRCC advises of termination of SAR activities. Cancel the DETRESFA by a message addressed to the same stations as the DETRESFA message.\nA separate chronological record should be kept on each ALERFA and DETRESFA together with a chart which displays the projected route of the aircraft, position reports received, route of interceptor aircraft, and other pertinent information.\nINFLIGHT CONTINGENCIES\nIf an aircraft over water requests weather, sea conditions, ditching information, and/or assistance from surface vessels, or if the controller feels that this information may be necessary for aircraft safety, it should be requested from the RCC. Also, an appropriate AMVER SURPIC should be asked for if requested by the aircraft or deemed beneficial by control personnel.\nNOTE-\nThe AMVER Center can deliver, in a matter of minutes, a SURPIC of vessels in the area of a SAR incident, including their predicted positions and their characteristics.\nIn all cases of aircraft ditching, the airspace required for SAR operations must be determined by the RCC. The ACC must block that airspace until the RCC advises the airspace is no longer required. An International Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) must be issued describing the airspace affected.\nThe following actions will be taken in the event an aircraft must make an emergency descent:\nIn the event an aircraft requests an emergency descent:\nIssue a clearance to the requested altitude if approved separation can be provided.\nAdvise the aircraft of the traffic, and request its intentions if traffic prevents an unrestricted descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATC ADVISES (aircraft identification) UNABLE TO APPROVE UNRESTRICTED DESCENT.\nTRAFFIC (traffic information).\nREQUEST INTENTIONS.\nIn the event an aircraft is making or will make an emergency descent without a clearance:\nAdvise other aircraft of the emergency descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATC ADVISES (aircraft identification/all aircraft) BE ALERT FOR EMERGENCY DESCENT IN THE VICINITY OF (latitude/longitude) FROM (altitude/FL) TO (altitude/FL).\nAdvise other aircraft when the emergency descent is complete.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Aircraft identification/all aircraft) EMERGENCY DESCENT AT (location) COMPLETED.\nUpon notification that an aircraft is making an emergency descent through other traffic, take action immediately to safeguard all aircraft concerned.\nWhen appropriate, broadcast by ATC communications, by radio navigation aids, and/or through aeronautical communication stations/services an emergency message to all aircraft in the vicinity of the descending aircraft. Include the following information:\nLocation of emergency descent.\nDirection of flight.\nType aircraft.\nRoute if appropriate.\nAltitude vacated.\nOther information.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft in the vicinity of Trout, a northbound D‐C Ten on A‐T‐S Route Alfa Seven Hundred is making an emergency descent from flight level three three zero.” (Repeat as you deem appropriate.)\nIf traffic conditions permit, provide traffic information to the affected aircraft.\nImmediately after an emergency broadcast or traffic information has been made, issue appropriate clearances or instructions, as necessary, to all aircraft involved.\nSERVICES TO RESCUE AIRCRAFT\nProvide IFR separation between the SAR and the aircraft in distress, except when visual or radar contact has been established by the search and rescue aircraft and the pilots of both aircraft concur, IFR separation may be discontinued.\nClear the SAR aircraft to a fixed clearance limit rather than to the aircraft in distress, which is a moving fix. Issue route clearances that are consistent with that of the distressed aircraft.\nAdvise the rescue aircraft, as soon as practicable, of any factors that could adversely affect its mission; e.g., unfavorable weather conditions, anticipated problems, the possibility of not being able to approve an IFR descent through en route traffic, etc.\nAdvise the appropriate rescue agency of all pertinent information as it develops.\nForward immediately any information about the action being taken by the RCC, other organizations, or aircraft to the aircraft concerned.\nAdvise the aircraft operator of the current status of the SAR operation as soon as practicable.\nSince prompt, correct, and complete information is the key to successful rescue operations, ensure that this information is swiftly and smoothly supplied to those organizations actively engaged in rescue operations.",

    "content": "Canadian Airspace ProceduresGeneral Control\nSection 1. General ControlAPPLICATION\nWhere control responsibility within Canadian airspace has been formally delegated to the FAA by the Transport Canada Aviation Group, apply basic FAA procedures except for the Canadian procedures contained in this chapter.\nNOTE-\nIn 1985, the U.S. and Canada established an agreement recognizing the inherent safety of the ATC procedures exercised by the other country. This agreement permits the use of ATC procedures of one country when that country is exercising ATC in the airspace over the territory of the other country insofar as they are not inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the laws and regulations or unique operational requirements of the country over whose territory such airspace is located. Accordingly, this chapter was revised to include only those Canadian procedures that must be used because of a Canadian regulatory or unique operational requirement.\nAIRSPACE CLASSIFICATION\nClass A airspace. Controlled airspace within which only IFR flights are permitted. Airspace designated from the base of all controlled high level airspace up to and including FL 600.\nClass B airspace. Controlled airspace within which only IFR and Controlled VFR (CVFR) flights are permitted. Includes all controlled low level airspace above 12,500 feet ASL or at and above the minimum en route IFR altitude, (whichever is higher) up to but not including 18,000 feet ASL. ATC procedures pertinent to IFR flights must be applied to CVFR aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThe CVFR pilot is responsible to maintain VFR flight and visual reference to the ground at all times.\nClass C airspace. Controlled airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but VFR flights require a clearance from ATC to enter.\nClass D airspace. Controlled airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but VFR flights do not require a clearance from ATC to enter, however, they must establish two-way communications with the appropriate ATC agency prior to entering the airspace.\nClass E airspace. Airspace within which both IFR and VFR flights are permitted, but for VFR flight there are no special requirements.\nClass F airspace. Airspace of defined dimensions within which activities must be confined because of their nature, or within which limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or both. Special use airspace may be classified as Class F advisory or Class F restricted.\nClass G airspace. Uncontrolled airspace within which ATC has neither the authority nor responsibility for exercising control over air traffic.\nONE THOUSAND-ON-TOP\nClear an aircraft to maintain “at least 1,000 feet‐on‐top” in lieu of “VFR‐on‐top,” provided:\nThe pilot requests it.\nNOTE-\nIt is the pilot's responsibility to ensure that the requested operation can be conducted at least 1,000 feet above all cloud, haze, smoke, or other formation, with a flight visibility of 3 miles or more. A pilot's request can be considered as confirmation that conditions are adequate.\nThe pilot will not operate within Class A or Class B airspace.\nSEPARATION\nApply a lateral, longitudinal, or vertical separation minimum between aircraft operating in accordance with an IFR or CVFR clearance, regardless of the weather conditions.\nDEPARTURE CLEARANCE/COMMUNICATION FAILURE\nBase controller action regarding radio failures in Canadian airspace on the requirement for pilots to comply with Canadian Airspace Regulations, which are similar to 14 CFR section 91.185; however, the following major difference must be considered when planning control actions. Except when issued alternate radio failure instructions by ATC, pilots will adhere to the following: If flying a turbine‐powered (turboprop or turbojet) aircraft and cleared on departure to a point other than the destination, proceed to the destination airport in accordance with the flight plan, maintaining the last assigned altitude or flight level or the minimum en route IFR altitude, whichever is higher, until 10 minutes beyond the point specified in the clearance (clearance limit), and then proceed at altitude(s) or flight level(s) filed in the flight plan. When the aircraft will enter U.S. airspace within 10 minutes after passing the clearance limit, the climb to the flight planned border crossing altitude is to be commenced at the estimated time of crossing the Canada/U.S. boundary.\nPARACHUTE JUMPING\nDo not authorize parachute jumping without prior permission from the appropriate Canadian authority.\nNOTE-\nCanadian regulations require written authority from the Ministry of Transport.\nSPECIAL VFR (SVFR)\nNOTE-\nPilots do not have to be IFR qualified to fly SVFR at night, nor does the aircraft have to be equipped for IFR flight.\nWithin a control zone where there is an airport controller on duty, approve or refuse a pilot's request for SVFR on the basis of current or anticipated IFR traffic only. If approved, specify the period of time during which SVFR flight is permitted.\nWithin a control zone where there is no airport controller on duty, authorize or refuse an aircraft's request for SVFR on the basis of:\nCurrent or anticipated IFR traffic, and\nOfficial ceiling and visibility reports.\nCanadian SVFR weather minimums for:\nAircraft other than helicopters. Flight visibility (ground visibility when reported) 1 mile.\nHelicopters. Flight visibility (ground visibility when available) 1/2 mile.",

Conflict probe does not account for instances in which greater separation may be needed (e.g., non-standard formations, A380) or where reduced separation is permitted (e.g., 3 mile airspace).\nWhen a conflict probe alert is displayed and when sector priorities permit, give consideration to the following in determining a solution:\nSolutions that involve direct routing, altitude changes, removal of a flight direction constraint (i.e., inappropriate altitude for direction of flight), and/or removal of a static restriction for one or more pertinent aircraft.\nImpact on surrounding sector traffic and complexity levels, flight efficiencies, and user preferences.\nWhen the Stop Probe feature is activated for an aircraft, conflict probe for that aircraft must be restarted before transfer of control, unless otherwise coordinated.\nNOTE-\nThe requirement in subparagraph 13-1-2e does not apply to aircraft entering a non EDST facility.\nTRIAL PLANNING\nWhen EDST is operational at the sector and when sector priorities permit, use the trial plan capability to evaluate:\nSolutions to predicted conflicts.\nThe feasibility of granting user requests.\nThe feasibility of removing a flight direction constraint (i.e., inappropriate altitude for direction of flight) for an aircraft.\nThe feasibility of removing a static restriction for an aircraft.\nCONFLICT PROBE-BASED CLEARANCES\nWhen the results of a trial plan based upon a user request indicate the absence of alerts, every effort should be made to grant the user request, unless the change is likely to adversely affect operations at another sector.\nTHE AIRCRAFT LIST (ACL), DEPARTURE LIST (DL) AND FLIGHT DATA MANAGEMENT\nThe ACL must be used as the sector team's primary source of flight data.\nActively scan EDST to identify automated notifications that require sector team action.\nWhen an ACL or DL entry has a Remarks indication, the Remarks field of the flight plan must be reviewed. Changes to the Remarks field must also be reviewed.\nHighlighting an entry on the ACL or DL must be used to indicate the flight requires an action or special attention.\nThe Special Posting Area (SPA) should be used to group aircraft that have special significance (e.g., aircraft to be sequenced, air refueling missions, formations).\nSector teams must post flight progress strips for any nonradar flights.\nA flight progress strip must be posted for any flight plan not contained in the EAS.\nSector teams must post any flight progress strip(s) that are deemed necessary for safe or efficient operations. The sector team must comply with all applicable facility directives to maintain posted flight progress strips.\nThe Drop Track Delete option must be used in accordance with facility directives.\nMANUAL COORDINATION AND THE COORDINATION MENU\nWhere automated coordination with a facility is not available (e.g., an international facility, a VFR tower), use the Coordination Menu or a flight progress strip to annotate manual coordination status, in accordance with facility directives.\nWhen the Coordination Menu is used and the flight plan is subsequently changed, remove the yellow coding from the Coordination Indicator after any appropriate action has been taken.\nHOLDING\nFor flights in hold, use the Hold View, Hold Data Menu, hold message, a flight progress strip, or a facility approved worksheet, to annotate holding instructions, in accordance with facility directives.\nRECORDING OF CONTROL DATA\nAll control information not otherwise recorded via automation recordings or voice recordings must be manually recorded using approved methods.\nWhen a verbal point out has been approved, remove the yellow color coding on the ACL.\nWhen the ACL or DL Free Text Area is used to enter control information, authorized abbreviations must be used.

Do not send/acknowledge ERT coding unless the sector has track control for the flight or it has been otherwise coordinated.\nRoute Action Notifications (RAN) such as ATC preferred routes or route processing errors must be amended at the first control position that displays the RAN unless verbally coordinated or as specified in appropriate facility directives. Do not remove RAN coding unless the sector has track control or it has been otherwise coordinated.\nCURRENCY OF TRAJECTORY INFORMATION\nThe sector team must perform automation entries in a timely manner.\nNOTE-\nConflict probe accuracy requires timely updates of data used to model each flight's trajectory. If this data is not current, the aircraft entries and notification of probe results for surrounding sectors and facilities, as well as the subject sector, may be misleading.\nData used to model an individual aircraft's trajectory includes route of flight, assigned and interim altitudes, application/removal of an adapted restriction for that flight, and aircraft type.\nAn exception to the requirement to enter or update interim altitudes may be authorized for certain ARTCC sectors if explicitly defined in an appropriate facility directive.\nNOTE-\nConflict probe accuracy in assigning alert notification is dependent upon entry/update of a flight's interim altitude.\nDELAY REPORTING\nAdhere to all applicable delay reporting directives.\nDelay information must be recorded. Delay information may be automatically recorded via use of the ERAM Hold Data Menu, ERAM Hold View, a hold message, or manually on flight progress strips or facility-approved worksheets, in accordance with the facility-defined standard.\nNOTE-\nWhen using the ERAM Hold Data Menu or Hold View, delays are automatically recorded when the aircraft is cleared out of hold.\nOVERDUE AIRCRAFT\nUpon receipt of the overdue aircraft notification take appropriate actions set forth in Chapter 10, Section 3, Overdue aircraft.\nNOTE-\nESDT overdue aircraft notification is based on radar track data. Updating an aircraft's route of fight will remove the overdue aircraft notification.\nUSE OF GRAPHICS PLAN DISPLAY (GPD)\nGraphic depictions of flight trajectories may be used only to aid in situational awareness and strategic planning.\nDo not use trajectory-based positions as a substitute for radar track position.\nDo not use trajectory-based altitude in lieu of Mode C for altitude confirmation.",

Utilize conflict probe results when issuing a clearance to ensure that any potential conflict has been given thorough consideration.\nUse of Probe when Accepting Manual Transfers. Prior to manually accepting an aircraft transfer from an external facility ensure that the coordinated flight profile is accurately entered, conflict probe initiated and, if necessary, action is taken to resolve any potential conflicts.\nTrial Probe. The controller can utilize trial probe to assess whether there are any potential conflicts with a proposed clearance or when performing manual coordination.\nNOTE-\nOnce initiated, trial probe does not take into account any changes made to the proposed profile or to any other flight profile in the system. It is an assessment by conflict probe of the current situation at the time the controller enters the trial probe. A trial probe does not alleviate the controller from performing a conflict probe when issuing a clearance or accepting a transfer.\nSystem Unable to Perform Conflict Probe for a Specific Aircraft.\nIf a flight's profile becomes corrupted, conflict probe may not be able to correctly monitor separation for that flight.

(See Pilot/Controller Glossary terms - Runway and Helipad.)\nFlight operations in accordance with the options of “due regard” or “operational” have the following requirements:\nObligates the authorized state aircraft commander to:\nSeparate his/her aircraft from all other air traffic; and\nAssure that an appropriate monitoring agency assumes responsibility for search and rescue actions; and\nOperate under at least one of the following conditions:\nIn visual meteorological conditions (VMC); or\nWithin an area that is covered by an ATC surveillance source and in communications with ATC, or within surveillance source service volume and radio communications range of a facility, Department of Homeland Security or DoD unit capable of providing the pilot assistance to operate with due regard to other aircraft; or\nBe equipped with airborne radar that is sufficient to provide separation between his/her aircraft and any other aircraft he/she may be controlling and other aircraft; or\nOperate within Class G airspace.\nAn understanding between the pilot and controller regarding the intent of the pilot and the status of the flight should be reached before the aircraft leaves ATC frequency.\nNOTE-\nA pilot's use of the phrase “Going Tactical” does not indicate “Due Regard.”\nThe above conditions provide for a level of safety equivalent to that normally given by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ATC agencies and fulfills U.S. Government obligations under Article 3, paragraph d, of the Chicago Convention of 1944, which stipulates there must be “due regard for the safety of navigation of civil aircraft” when flight is not being conducted under ICAO flight procedures.\nREFERENCE-\nDoD Instruction (DoDI) 4540.1, Enclosure 3, Para 3c(1)(c).\nDoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP), Section 8-6c(1).\n“CFR” means Code of Federal Regulations.\nFIG 1-2-1Divergence\nCOURSE DEFINITIONS\nThe following definitions must be used in the application of the separation criteria in this order.\nNOTE-\nThe term “protected airspace,” as used in this paragraph, is the airspace equal to one half the required applicable lateral separation on either side of an aircraft along its projected flight path. If the protected airspace of two aircraft does not overlap, applicable lateral separation is ensured.\nSAME COURSES are courses whose protected airspaces are coincident, overlap, or intersect and whose angular difference is less than 45 degrees. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\nCROSSING COURSES are intersecting courses whose angular difference is 45 through 135 degrees inclusive. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\nOPPOSITE/RECIPROCAL COURSES are courses whose protected airspaces are coincident, overlap, or intersect and whose angular difference is greater than 135 degrees through 180 degrees inclusive. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\nNOTES\nStatements of fact, or of a prefatory or explanatory nature relating to directive material, are set forth as notes.\nREFERENCES\nAs used in this order, references direct attention to an additional or supporting source of information such as FAA, NWS, and other agencies' orders, directives, notices, CFRs, and Advisory Circulars (ACs).\nANNOTATIONS\nRevised, reprinted, or new pages are marked as follows:\nThe change number and the effective date are printed on each revised or additional page.\nA page that does not require a change is reprinted in its original form.\nBold vertical lines in the margin of changed pages indicate the location of substantive revisions to the order. Bold vertical lines adjacent to the title of a chapter, section, or paragraph means that extensive changes have been made to that chapter, section, or paragraph.\nParagraphs/sections annotated with EN ROUTE, OCEANIC, or TERMINAL are only to be applied by the designated type facility. When they are not so designated, the paragraphs/sections apply to all types of facilities (en route, oceanic, and terminal).\nThe annotation, USAF for the U.S. Air Force, USN for the U.S. Navy, and USA for the U.S. Army denotes that the procedure immediately following the annotation applies only to the designated service.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-12, Military Procedures.",

    "content": "Use nonradar separation in preference to radar separation when the situation dictates that an operational advantage will be gained.\nNOTE-\nOne situation may be where vertical separation would preclude excessive vectoring.\nOPERATIONAL PRIORITY\nIt is recognized that traffic flow may affect the controller's ability to provide priority handling. However, without compromising safety, good judgment must be used in each situation to facilitate the most expeditious movement of priority aircraft. Provide air traffic control service to aircraft on a “first come, first served” basis as circumstances permit, except the following:\nNOTE-\nIt is solely the pilot's prerogative to cancel an IFR flight plan. However, a pilot's retention of an IFR flight plan does not afford priority over VFR aircraft. For example, this does not preclude the requirement for the pilot of an arriving IFR aircraft to adjust his/her flight path, as necessary, to enter a traffic pattern in sequence with arriving VFR aircraft.\nAn aircraft in distress has the right of way over all other air traffic.\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR Section 91.113(c).\nTreat air ambulance flights as follows:\nProvide priority handling to civil air ambulance flights when the pilot, in radio transmissions, verbally identifies the flight by stating “MEDEVAC” followed by the FAA authorized call sign or the full civil registration letters/numbers. Good judgment must be used in each situation to facilitate the most expeditious movement of a MEDEVAC aircraft.\nNOTE-\nIf a flight plan includes the letter “L” for “MEDEVAC” and/or includes “MEDEVAC” in Item 11 (Remarks) of the flight plan or Item 18 (Other Information) of an international flight plan, the entries are considered informational in nature only and not an identification for operational priority.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nProvide priority handling to AIR EVAC and HOSP flights when verbally requested by the pilot.\nNOTE-\nIf a flight plan includes “HOSP” or “AIR EVAC” in either Item 11 (Remarks) or Item 18 (Other Information) of an international flight plan, the entries are considered informational in nature only and not an identification for operational priority. For aircraft identification in radio transmissions, civilian pilots will use normal call signs when filing “HOSP” and military pilots will use the “EVAC” call sign.\nAssist the pilots of MEDEVAC, AIR EVAC, and HOSP aircraft to avoid areas of significant weather and adverse conditions.\nIf requested by a pilot, provide additional assistance (i.e., landline notifications) to expedite ground handling of patients, vital organs, or urgently needed medical materials.\nProvide priority handling and expedite the movement of presidential aircraft and entourage and any rescue support aircraft as well as related control messages when traffic conditions and communications facilities permit.\nNOTE-\nAs used herein the terms presidential aircraft and entourage include aircraft and entourage of the President, Vice President, or other public figures when designated by the White House.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-2, Departure Clearances.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-1-1, Advance Coordination.\nProvide priority handling and maximum assistance to SAR aircraft performing a SAR mission.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-3, Providing Assistance.\nProvide priority handling and maximum assistance to expedite the movement of interceptor aircraft on active air defense missions until the unknown aircraft is identified.\nProvide priority handling to NIGHT WATCH “NAOC” (pronounced NAY-OCK) aircraft when notified via landline or when “NAOC” is used in air/ground communications. When the term “NAOC” is used, approve any request(s) as soon as practicable.\nNOTE-\nThe term “NAOC” will not be a part of the Flight ID in the flight plan or used in conjunction with the call sign but may otherwise be used when the aircraft is airborne.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 9-1-1, Applications.\nProvide priority handling to any civil or military aircraft using the code name “FLYNET.\"\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-5, FLYNET.\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 9-4-1, “FLYNET” Flights, Nuclear Emergency Teams.\nProvide priority handling to aircraft using the code name “Garden Plot” only when CARF notifies you that such priority is authorized. Refer any questions regarding flight procedures to CARF for resolution.\nNOTE-\nGarden Plot flights require priority movement and are coordinated by the military with CARF. State authority will contact the Regional Administrator to arrange for priority of National Guard troop movements within a particular state.\nProvide priority handling to USAF or other government aircraft engaged in aerial sampling/surveying missions using the call sign “SAMP.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-17, SAMP Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-3-2, Aerial Sampling/Surveying For Airborne Contamination.\nProvide priority handling to Special Air Mission “SCOOT” aircraft when notified via landline or when “SCOOT” is used in air/ground communications. When the term “SCOOT” is used, approve any request(s) as soon as practicable.\nNOTE-\nThe term “SCOOT” will not be a part of the Flight ID in the flight plan but may be used during radio communications in conjunction with the call sign.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.4, Para 9-6-1, Applications.\nWhen requested, provide priority handling to TEAL and NOAA mission aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-19, Weather Reconnaissance Flights.\nProvide priority handling, as required to expedite Flight Check aircraft.\nNOTE-\nIt is recognized that unexpected wind conditions, weather, or heavy traffic flows may affect controller's ability to provide priority or special handling at the specific time requested.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-1-3, Flight Check Aircraft.\nIFR aircraft must have priority over SVFR aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 7, Section 5, Special VFR (SVFR).\nAircraft operating under the North American Route Program (NRP) are not subject to route limiting restrictions (e.g., published preferred IFR routes, letter of agreement requirements, standard operating procedures).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-15, North American Route Program (NRP) Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 18, Section 17, North American Route Program.\nIf able, provide priority handling to diverted flights. Priority handling may be requested via use of “DVRSN\" in the remarks section of the flight plan or by the flight being placed on the Diversion Recovery Tool (DRT).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 18-4-5, Diversion Recovery.\nIf able, provide priority handling to FALLEN HERO flights when “FALLEN HERO\" is indicated in the remarks section of the flight plan or requested in air/ground communications.\nEXPEDITIOUS COMPLIANCE\nUse the word “immediately” only when expeditious compliance is required to avoid an imminent situation.\nUse the word “expedite” only when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an imminent situation. If an “expedite\" climb or descent clearance is issued by ATC, and subsequently the altitude to maintain is changed or restated without an expedite instruction, the expedite instruction is canceled.\nIn either case, if time permits, include the reason for this action.\nSAFETY ALERT\nIssue a safety alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is in a position/altitude that, in your judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft. Once the pilot informs you action is being taken to resolve the situation, you may discontinue the issuance of further alerts. Do not assume that because someone else has responsibility for the aircraft that the unsafe situation has been observed and the safety alert issued; inform the appropriate controller.\nNOTE-\nThe issuance of a safety alert is a first priority (see paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority) once the controller observes and recognizes a situation of unsafe aircraft proximity to terrain, obstacles, or other aircraft. Conditions, such as workload, traffic volume, the quality/limitations of the radar system, and the available lead time to react are factors in determining whether it is reasonable for the controller to observe and recognize such situations. While a controller cannot see immediately the development of every situation where a safety alert must be issued, the controller must remain vigilant for such situations and issue a safety alert when the situation is recognized.\nRecognition of situations of unsafe proximity may result from MSAW/E-MSAW, automatic altitude readouts, Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert, observations on a PAR scope, or pilot reports.\nOnce the alert is issued, it is solely the pilot's prerogative to determine what course of action, if any, will be taken.\nTerrain/Obstruction Alert. Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware the aircraft is at an altitude that, in your judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain and/or obstructions. Issue the alert as follows:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nLOW ALTITUDE ALERT (call sign),\nCHECK YOUR ALTITUDE IMMEDIATELY.\nand, if the aircraft is not yet on final approach,\nTHE (as appropriate) MEA/MVA/MOCA/MIA IN YOUR AREA IS (altitude).\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - FINAL APPROACH-IFR\nAircraft Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert. Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware of another aircraft at an altitude that you believe places them in unsafe proximity. If feasible, offer the pilot an alternate course of action. When an alternate course of action is given, end the transmission with the word “immediately.”\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTRAFFIC ALERT (call sign) (position of aircraft) ADVISE YOU TURN LEFT/RIGHT (heading),\nand/or\nCLIMB/DESCEND (specific altitude if appropriate) IMMEDIATELY.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Traffic Alert, Cessna Three Four Juliett, 12'o clock, 1 mile advise you turn left immediately.”\nor\n“Traffic Alert, Cessna Three-Four Juliett, 12'o clock, 1 mile advise you turn left and climb immediately.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-1, Conflict Alert (CA) and Mode C Intruder (MCI) Alert.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-2, En Route Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (E-MSAW).\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-14-6, CA/MCI.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-21, Altitude Filters.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nINFLIGHT EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS\nWhen a pilot reports an inflight equipment malfunction, determine the nature and extent of any special handling desired.\nNOTE-\nInflight equipment malfunctions include partial or complete failure of equipment, which may affect either safety, separation standards, and/or the ability of the flight to proceed under IFR, or in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace, in the ATC system. Controllers may expect reports from pilots regarding VOR, TACAN, ADF, GPS, RVSM capability, or low frequency navigation receivers, impairment of air-ground communications capability, or other equipment deemed appropriate by the pilot (e.g., airborne weather radar). Pilots should communicate the nature and extent of any assistance desired from ATC.\nProvide the maximum assistance possible consistent with equipment, workload, and any special handling requested.\nRelay to other controllers or facilities who will subsequently handle the aircraft, all pertinent details concerning the aircraft and any special handling required or being provided.\nMINIMUM FUEL\nIf an aircraft declares a state of “minimum fuel,” inform any facility to whom control jurisdiction is transferred of the minimum fuel problem and be alert for any occurrence which might delay the aircraft en route.\nNOTE-\nUse of the term “minimum fuel” indicates recognition by a pilot that his/her fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching destination, he/she cannot accept any undue delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely an advisory that indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur. A minimum fuel advisory does not imply a need for traffic priority. Common sense and good judgment will determine the extent of assistance to be given in minimum fuel situations. If, at any time, the remaining usable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing, the pilot should declare an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes.\nREPORTING ESSENTIAL FLIGHT INFORMATION\nReport as soon as possible to the appropriate FSS, airport manager's office, ARTCC, approach control facility, operations office, or military operations office any information concerning components of the NAS or any flight conditions which may have an adverse effect on air safety.\nNOTE-\nFSSs are responsible for classifying and disseminating Notices to Airmen.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-3, Timely Information.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-1-2, Periodic Maintenance.\nUSN, See OPNAVINST 3721.30.\nNAVAID MALFUNCTIONS\nWhen an aircraft reports a ground-based NAVAID malfunction, take the following actions:\nRequest a report from a second aircraft.\nIf the second aircraft reports normal operations, continue use and inform the first aircraft. Record the incident on FAA Form 7230-4 or appropriate military form.\nIf the second aircraft confirms the malfunction or in the absence of a second aircraft report, activate the standby equipment or request the monitor facility to activate.\nIf normal operation is reported after the standby equipment is activated, continue use, record the incident on FAA Form 7230-4 or appropriate military form, and notify technical operations personnel (the Systems Engineer of the ARTCC when an en route aid is involved).\nIf continued malfunction is reported after the standby equipment is activated or the standby equipment cannot be activated, inform technical operations personnel and request advice on whether or not the aid should be shut down. In the absence of a second aircraft report, advise the technical operations personnel of the time of the initial aircraft report and the estimated time a second aircraft report could be obtained.\nWhen an aircraft reports a GPS or WAAS anomaly, request the following information and/or take the following actions:\nRecord the following minimum information:\nAircraft make, model, and call sign.\nLocation or position, and altitude at the time where GPS or WAAS anomaly was observed.\nDate/time of occurrence.\nRequest a report from a second aircraft.\nRecord the incident on FAA Form 7230-4 or appropriate military form.\nInform other aircraft of the anomaly as specified in subparagraph 4-8-1k, l, or m, as applicable.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, GPS REPORTED UNRELIABLE (OR WAAS UNAVAILABLE) IN VICINITY/AREA (position).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft, GPS reported unreliable (or WAAS unavailable) in the area 30 miles south of Waco VOR.”\nWhen a pilot reports a WAAS anomaly, determine from the pilot what indications he or she observes and record the information in accordance with subparagraph b above.\nUSE OF MARSA\nMARSA may only be applied to military operations specified in a letter of agreement or other appropriate FAA or military document.\nNOTE-\nApplication of MARSA is a military command prerogative. It will not be invoked indiscriminately by individual units or pilots. It will be used only for IFR operations requiring its use. Commands authorizing MARSA will ensure that its implementation and terms of use are documented and coordinated with the control agency having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations are conducted. Terms of use will assign responsibility and provide for separation among participating aircraft.\nATC facilities do not invoke or deny MARSA. Their sole responsibility concerning the use of MARSA is to provide separation between military aircraft engaged in MARSA operations and other nonparticipating IFR aircraft.\nDoD must ensure that military pilots requesting special use airspace/ATCAAs have coordinated with the scheduling agency, have obtained approval for entry, and are familiar with the appropriate MARSA procedures. ATC is not responsible for determining which military aircraft are authorized to enter special use airspace/ATCAAs.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-13, Military Aerial Refueling.\nMILITARY PROCEDURES\nMilitary procedures in the form of additions, modifications, and exceptions to the basic FAA procedure are prescribed herein when a common procedure has not been attained or to fulfill a specific requirement. They must be applied by:\nATC facilities operated by that military service.\nEXAMPLE-\nAn Air Force facility providing service for an Air Force base would apply USAF procedures to all traffic regardless of class.\nA Navy facility providing service for a Naval Air Station would apply USN procedures to all traffic regardless of class.\nATC facilities, regardless of their parent organization (FAA, USAF, USN, USA), supporting a designated military airport exclusively. This designation determines which military procedures are to be applied.\nEXAMPLE-\nAn FAA facility supports a USAF base exclusively; USAF procedures are applied to all traffic at that base.\nAn FAA facility provides approach control service for a Naval Air Station as well as supporting a civil airport; basic FAA procedures are applied at both locations by the FAA facility.\nA USAF facility supports a USAF base and provides approach control service to a satellite civilian airport; USAF procedures are applied at both locations by the USAF facility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-2-5, Annotations.\nOther ATC facilities when specified in a letter of agreement.\nEXAMPLE-\nA USAF unit is using a civil airport supported by an FAA facility- USAF procedures will be applied as specified in a letter of agreement between the unit and the FAA facility to the aircraft of the USAF unit. Basic FAA procedures will be applied to all other aircraft.\nFORMATION FLIGHTS\nControl formation flights as a single aircraft. Separation responsibility between aircraft within the formation rests with the flight leader and the pilots of the other aircraft in the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are maneuvering to attain separation from each other to effect individual control during join-up and breakaway.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - FORMATION FLIGHT.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 3, Military Formation Flight.\nICAO Annex 2, 3.1.8 Formation Flights.\nSupport formation flight join-up for two aircraft when all of the following occur:\nRequested by any participating pilot.\nAll participating pilots concur.\nEither of the participating pilots reports the other/s in sight.\nEXAMPLE-\n“ROOK01 has EAGLE03 in sight, request formation join-up with EAGLE03 at flight level two zero zero. EAGLE03 will be the lead.”\n“EAGLE03 verify requesting flight join-up with ROOK01.”\nIf affirmative:\n“ROOK01 climb and maintain flight level two zero zero.  Report (advise) when formation join-up is complete.”\nIf multiple single aircraft request to join-up, multiple formations are joining as one, or aircraft are joining an established formation, obtain confirmation of required items listed in subparagraph 2-1-13a, from the lead aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - FORMATION FLIGHT.\nAfter join-up, aircraft beacon code assignment will be determined by formation type.\nFor a standard formation only the aircraft acting as the lead will squawk an ATC assigned beacon code. Ensure all other aircraft squawk standby.\nFor a nonstandard formation, each aircraft should squawk an ATC assigned beacon code.  Controller discretion allows aircraft in a nonstandard formation to squawk standby if operationally advantageous.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Para 7-3-6, Nonstandard Formation Tactics, Subpara b3.\nEXAMPLE-\n“N123JP squawk standby.”\nOr\n“N123SP have N123JP squawk standby.”\nWhen formation break-up is requested, issue control instructions and/or clearances which will result in approved separation through the lead or directly to the requesting aircraft in the formation.\nEXAMPLE-\n“N5871S requesting flight break-up with N731K. N731K is changing destination to PHL.”\n“N731K squawk 5432, turn right, fly heading zero-seven-zero.\n“Center, BAMA21. BAMA23 is requesting to RTB.”\n“BAMA21 have BAMA23 squawk 5544, descend and maintain flight level one-niner-zero and change to my frequency.”\n“Center, BAMA21.

Descend and maintain flight level one-niner-zero.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-8, Additional Separation for Formation Flights.\nP/CG Term - FORMATION FLIGHT.\nMilitary and civil formation flights in RVSM airspace.\nUtilize RVSM separation standards for a formation flight, which consists of all RVSM approved aircraft.\nUtilize non-RVSM separation standards for a formation flight at or above FL 290, which does not consist of all RVSM approved aircraft.\nIf aircraft are requesting to form a formation flight to FL 290 or above, the controller who issues the clearance creating the formation flight is responsible for ensuring that the proper equipment suffix is entered for the lead aircraft.\nIf the flight departs as a formation, and is requesting FL 290 or above, the first center sector must ensure that the proper equipment suffix is entered.\nIf the formation flight is below FL 290 and later requests FL 290 or above, the controller receiving the RVSM altitude request must ensure the proper equipment suffix is entered.\nUpon break-up of the formation flight, the controller initiating the break-up must ensure that all aircraft or flights are assigned their proper equipment suffix.\nCOORDINATE USE OF AIRSPACE\nEnsure that the necessary coordination has been accomplished before you allow an aircraft under your control to enter another controller's area of jurisdiction.\nBefore you issue a control instruction directly to a pilot that will change the aircraft's heading, route, speed, or altitude, you must ensure that coordination has been completed with all controllers whose area of jurisdiction is affected by those instructions unless otherwise specified by a letter of agreement or facility directive. If your control instruction will be relayed to the pilot through a source other than another radar controller (FSS, New York Radio, San Francisco Radio, another pilot, etc.), you are still responsible to ensure that all required coordination is completed.\nNOTE-\nIt is good operating practice for controllers to confirm that required coordination has been/will be effected, especially in unusual circumstances, such as recently modified sector configurations, airspace changes, route changes, etc.\nEnsuring that all required coordination has been completed does not necessarily imply that the controller issuing the control instruction directly to the pilot has to perform the coordination action.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-15, Control Transfer.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-5-10, Adjacent Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-6, Receiving Controller Handoff.\nCONTROL TRANSFER\nTransfer control of an aircraft in accordance with the following conditions:\nAt a prescribed or coordinated location, time, fix, or altitude; or,\nAt the time a radar handoff and frequency change to the receiving controller have been completed and when authorized by a facility directive or letter of agreement which specifies the type and extent of control that is transferred.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-6, Receiving Controller Handoff.\nTransfer control of an aircraft only after eliminating any potential conflict with other aircraft for which you have separation responsibility.\nAssume control of an aircraft only after it is in your area of jurisdiction unless specifically coordinated or as specified by letter of agreement or a facility directive.\nSURFACE AREAS\nCoordinate with the appropriate nonapproach control tower on an individual aircraft basis before issuing a clearance which would require flight within a surface area for which the tower has responsibility unless otherwise specified in a letter of agreement.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-1, Letters of Agreement.\n14 CFR Section 91.127, Operating on or in the Vicinity of an Airport in Class E Airspace.\nP/CG Term - SURFACE AREA.\nCoordinate with the appropriate control tower for transit authorization when you are providing radar traffic advisory service to an aircraft that will enter another facility's airspace.\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is not expected to obtain his/her own authorization through each area when in contact with a radar facility.\nTransfer communications to the appropriate facility, if required, prior to operation within a surface area for which the tower has responsibility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-17, Radio Communications.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-11, Surface Area Restrictions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-6-1, Application.\n14 CFR Section 91.129, Operations in Class D Airspace.\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS\nTransfer radio communications before an aircraft enters the receiving controller's area of jurisdiction unless otherwise coordinated or specified by a letter of agreement or a facility directive.\nTransfer radio communications by specifying the following:\nNOTE-\nRadio communications transfer procedures may be specified by a letter of agreement or contained in the route description of an MTR as published in the DoD Planning AP/1B (AP/3).\nThe facility name or location name and terminal function to be contacted. TERMINAL:  Omit the location name when transferring communications to another controller within your facility, or, when the tower and TRACON share the same name (for example, Phoenix Tower and Phoenix TRACON).\nEXCEPTION. Controllers must include the name of the facility when instructing an aircraft to change frequency for final approach guidance.\nFrequency to use except the following may be omitted:\nFSS frequency.\nDeparture frequency if previously given or published on a SID chart for the procedure issued.\nTERMINAL:\nGround or local control frequency if in your opinion the pilot knows which frequency is in use.\nThe numbers preceding the decimal point if the ground control frequency is in the 121 MHz bandwidth.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Contact Tower.”\n“Contact Ground.”\n“Contact Ground Point Seven.”\n“Contact Ground, One Two Zero Point Eight.”\n“Contact Huntington Radio.”\n“Contact Departure.”\n“Contact Los Angeles Center, One Two Three Point Four.”\nTime, fix, altitude, or specifically when to contact a facility. You may omit this when compliance is expected upon receipt.\nNOTE-\nAIM, paragraph 5-3-1, ARTCC Communications, informs pilots that they are expected to maintain a listening watch on the transferring controller's frequency until the time, fix, or altitude specified.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCONTACT (facility name or location name and terminal function), (frequency).\nIf required,\nAT (time, fix, or altitude).\nControllers must, within a reasonable amount of time, take appropriate action to establish/restore communications with all aircraft for which a communications transfer or initial contact to his/her sector is expected/required.\nNOTE-\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, a reasonable amount of time is considered to be 5 minutes from the time the aircraft enters the controller's area of jurisdiction or comes within range of radio/communications coverage. Communications include two-way VHF or UHF radio contact, data link, or high frequency (HF) radio through an approved third-party provider such as New York Radio or San Francisco Radio.\nERAM facilities, beginning with initial audio contact with an aircraft, must utilize the voice communication indicator to reflect the current status of voice communications.\nIn situations where an operational advantage will be gained, and following coordination with the receiving controller, you may instruct aircraft on the ground to monitor the receiving controller's frequency.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Monitor Tower.”\n“Monitor Ground.”\n“Monitor Ground Point Seven.”\n“Monitor Ground, One Two Zero Point Eight.”\nIn situations where a sector has multiple frequencies or when sectors are combined using multiple frequencies and the aircraft will remain under your jurisdiction, transfer radio communication by specifying the following:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification) CHANGE TO MY FREQUENCY (state frequency).\nEXAMPLE-\n“United two twenty‐two change to my frequency one two three point four.”\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 4-2-3, Contact Procedures.\nAvoid issuing a frequency change to helicopters known to be single‐piloted during air‐taxiing, hovering, or low‐level flight. Whenever possible, relay necessary control instructions until the pilot is able to change frequency.\nNOTE-\nMost light helicopters are flown by one pilot and require the constant use of both hands and feet to maintain control. Although Flight Control Friction Devices assist the pilot, changing frequency near the ground could result in inadvertent ground contact and consequent loss of control. Pilots are expected to advise ATC of their single‐pilot status if unable to comply with a frequency change.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 4-3-14, Communications.\nIn situations where the controller does not want the pilot to change frequency but the pilot is expecting or may want a frequency change, use the following phraseology.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREMAIN THIS FREQUENCY.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-1, Clearance Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-12-9, Communication Transfer.\nOPERATIONAL REQUESTS\nRespond to a request from another controller, a pilot or vehicle operator by one of the following verbal means:\nRestate the request in complete or abbreviated terms followed by the word “APPROVED.” The phraseology “APPROVED AS REQUESTED” may be substituted in lieu of a lengthy readback.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Requested operation) APPROVED.\nor\nAPPROVED AS REQUESTED.\nState restrictions followed by the word “APPROVED.”\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Restriction and/or additional instructions, requested operation) APPROVED.\nState the word “UNABLE” and, time permitting, a reason.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNABLE (requested operation).\nand when necessary,\n(reason and/or additional instructions.)\nState the words “STAND BY.”\nNOTE-\n“STAND BY\" is not an approval or denial. The controller acknowledges the request and will respond at a later time.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-9-3, Methods.",

The use of these terms during direct pilot communications is not appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 8020.16, Air Traffic Organization Aircraft Accident and Aircraft Incident Notification, Investigation, and Reporting, Chapter 12, Para 3, Air Traffic Facility Responsibilities.\nTCAS RESOLUTION ADVISORIES\nWhen an aircraft under your control jurisdiction informs you that it is responding to a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA), do not issue control instructions that are contrary to the RA procedure that a crew member has advised you that they are executing. Provide safety alerts regarding terrain or obstructions and traffic advisories for the aircraft responding to the RA and all other aircraft under your control jurisdiction, as appropriate.\nUnless advised by other aircraft that they are also responding to a TCAS RA, do not assume that other aircraft in the proximity of the responding aircraft are involved in the RA maneuver or are aware of the responding aircraft's intended maneuvers. Continue to provide control instructions, safety alerts, and traffic advisories as appropriate to such aircraft.\nNOTE-\nWhen notified by the pilot of an RA, the controller is not prohibited from issuing traffic advisories and safety alerts.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nOnce the responding aircraft has begun a maneuver in response to an RA, the controller is not responsible for providing approved separation between the aircraft that is responding to an RA and any other aircraft, airspace, terrain or obstructions. Responsibility for approved separation resumes when one of the following conditions is met:\nThe responding aircraft has returned to its assigned altitude, or\nA crew member informs you that the TCAS maneuver is completed and you observe that approved separation has been reestablished, or\nThe responding aircraft has executed an alternate clearance and you observe that approved separation has been reestablished.\nNOTE-\nAC 120-55, Air Carrier Operational Approval and Use of TCAS II, suggests pilots use the following phraseology to notify controllers during TCAS events. When a TCAS RA may affect an ATC clearance, inform ATC when beginning the maneuver, or as soon as workload permits.\nEXAMPLE-\n“New York Center, United 321, TCAS RA.”\nNOTE-\nWhen the RA has been resolved, the flight crew should advise ATC they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or subsequent amended clearance.\nEXAMPLE-\n“New York Center, United 321, clear of conflict, returning to assigned altitude.”\nRVSM OPERATIONS\nRVSM operations are conducted in RVSM airspace that is defined as any airspace between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive, where eligible aircraft are separated vertically by 1,000 feet. Controller responsibilities must include but not be limited to the following:\nNon‐RVSM aircraft operating in RVSM airspace.\nEnsure non-RVSM aircraft are not permitted in RVSM airspace unless they meet the criteria of excepted aircraft and are previously approved by the operations supervisor/CIC. The following aircraft are excepted: DoD, DoD-certified aircraft operated by NASA (T38, F15, F18, WB57, S3, and U2 aircraft only), MEDEVAC, manufacturer aircraft being flown for development/certification, and Foreign State aircraft. These exceptions are accommodated on a workload or traffic-permitting basis.\nNOTE-\nThe operations supervisor/CIC is responsible for system acceptance of a non‐RVSM aircraft beyond the initial sector‐to‐sector coordination following the pilot request to access the airspace. Operations supervisor/CIC responsibilities are defined in FAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 6, Section 8, Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM).\nEnsure sector‐to‐sector coordination for all non‐RVSM aircraft operations within RVSM airspace.\nInform the operations supervisor/CIC when a non‐RVSM exception flight is denied clearance into RVSM airspace or is removed from RVSM airspace.\nNon-RVSM aircraft transitioning RVSM airspace.\nEnsure that operations supervisors/CICs are made aware when non‐RVSM aircraft are transitioning through RVSM airspace.\nApply appropriate separation standards and remove any aircraft from RVSM airspace that advises it is unable RVSM due to equipment while en route.\nUse “negative RVSM\" in all verbal ground‐to‐ground communications involving non‐RVSM aircraft while cleared to operate within RVSM airspace.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Point out Baxter1 climbing to FL 360, negative RVSM.”\nFor the following situations, use the associated phraseology:\nTo deny clearance into RVSM airspace.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“UNABLE CLEARANCE INTO RVSM AIRSPACE.”\nTo request a pilot to report when able to resume RVSM.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“REPORT ABLE TO RESUME RVSM.”\nIn the event of a change to an aircraft's RVSM eligibility, amend the RVSM qualifier (“W”) in the ICAO equipment string in order to properly identify non‐RVSM aircraft on the controller display.\nNOTE-\nChanging the equipment suffix instead of amending the equipment string may result in incorrect revisions to other ICAO qualifiers.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 5-1-9, International Flight Plan (FAA Form 7233-4) IFR Flights (For Domestic or International Flights).\nAIM, TBL 5-1-4, Aircraft COM, NAV, and Approach Equipment Qualifiers.",

    "content": "General ControlFlight Plans and Control Information\nSection 2. Flight Plans and Control InformationRECORDING INFORMATION\nRecord flight plan information required by the type of flight plan and existing circumstances. Use authorized abbreviations when possible.\nNOTE-\nGenerally, all military overseas flights are required to clear through a specified military base operations office (BASOPS). Pilots normally will not file flight plans directly with an FAA facility unless a BASOPS is not available. BASOPS will, in turn, forward the IFR flight notification message to the appropriate center.\nEN ROUTE. When flight plans are filed directly with the center, record all items given by the pilot either on a flight progress strip/flight data entry or on a voice recorder. If the latter, enter in box 26 of the initial flight progress strip the sector or position number to identify where the information may be found in the event search and rescue (SAR) activities become necessary.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFORWARDING INFORMATION\nExcept during EAS FDP operation, forward the flight plan information to the appropriate ATC facility, FSS, or BASOPS and record the time of filing and delivery on the form.\nEN ROUTE. During EAS FDP operation, the above manual actions are required in cases where the data is not forwarded automatically by the computer.\nNOTE-\nDuring EAS FDP operation, data is exchanged between interfaced automated facilities and both the data and time of transmission are recorded automatically.\nEN ROUTE. Forward proposed tower en route flight plans and any related amendments to the appropriate departure terminal facility.\nFORWARDING VFR DATA\nTERMINAL\nForward aircraft departure times to FSSs or military operations offices when they have requested them. Forward other VFR flight plan data only if requested by the pilot.\nMILITARY DVFR DEPARTURES\nTERMINAL\nForward departure times on all DVFR departures from joint-use airports to the military operations office.\nNOTE-\nDetails for handling air carrier and nonscheduled civil DVFR flight data are contained in FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations.\nCivil pilots departing DVFR from a joint-use airport will include the phrase “DVFR to (destination)” in their initial call-up to an FAA-operated tower.\nIFR TO VFR FLIGHT PLAN CHANGE\nRequest a pilot to contact the appropriate FSS if the pilot informs you of a desire to change from an IFR to a VFR flight plan.\nIFR FLIGHT PROGRESS DATA\nForward control information from controller to controller within a facility, then to the receiving facility as the aircraft progresses along its route. Where appropriate, use computer equipment in lieu of manual coordination procedures. Do not use the remarks section of flight progress strips in lieu of voice coordination to pass control information. Ensure that flight plan and control information is correct and up‐to‐date. When covered by a letter of agreement/facility directive, the time requirements of subparagraph a may be reduced, and the time requirements of subparagraph b1 and paragraph 2-2-11, Forwarding Amended and UTM Data, subparagraph a may be increased up to 15 minutes when facilitated by automated systems or mandatory radar handoffs; or if operationally necessary because of manual data processing or nonradar operations, the time requirements of subparagraph a may be increased.\nNOTE-\nThe procedures for preparing flight plan and control information related to altitude reservations (ALTRVs) are contained in FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 8-1-2, Facility Operation and Administration, ALTRV Flight Data Processing. Development of the methods for assuring the accuracy and completeness of ALTRV flight plan and control information is the responsibility of the military liaison and security officer.\nThe term facility in this paragraph refers to centers and terminal facilities when operating in an en route capacity.\nForward the following information at least 15 minutes before the aircraft is estimated to enter the receiving facility's area:\nAircraft identification.\nNumber of aircraft if more than one, heavy aircraft indicator “H/” if appropriate, type of aircraft, and aircraft equipment suffix.\nAssigned altitude and ETA over last reporting point/fix in transferring facility's area or assumed departure time when the departure point is the last point/fix in the transferring facility's area.\nAltitude at which aircraft will enter the receiving facility's area if other than the assigned altitude.\nTrue airspeed.\nPoint of departure.\nRoute of flight remaining.\nDestination airport and clearance limit if other than destination airport.\nETA at destination airport (not required for military or scheduled air carrier aircraft).\nAltitude requested by the aircraft if assigned altitude differs from requested altitude (within a facility only).\nNOTE-\nWhen an aircraft has crossed one facility's area and assignment at a different altitude is still desired, the pilot will reinitiate the request with the next facility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-8, Anticipated Altitude Changes.\nWhen flight plan data must be forwarded manually and an aircraft has been assigned a beacon code by the computer, include the code as part of the flight plan.\nNOTE-\nWhen an airborne aircraft that has been assigned a beacon code by the ARTCC computer and whose flight plan will terminate in another facility's area cancels ATC service, appropriate action should be taken to remove flight plan information on that aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-11, Forwarding Amended and UTM Data.\nLongitudinal separation being used in nonradar operations between aircraft at the same altitude if it results in these aircraft having less than 10 minutes separation at the facilities' boundary, unless (otherwise) specified in a Letter of Agreement (LOA).\nAny additional nonroutine operational information pertinent to flight safety.\nNOTE-\nEN ROUTE. This includes alerting the receiving controller that the flight is conducting celestial navigation training.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-2-2, Celestial Navigation Training.\nForward position report over last reporting point in the transferring facility's area if any of the following conditions exist:\nTime differs more than 3 minutes from estimate given.\nRequested by receiving facility.\nAgreed to between facilities.\nMANUAL INPUT OF COMPUTER‐ASSIGNED BEACON CODES\nWhen a flight plan is manually entered into the computer and a computer‐assigned beacon code has been forwarded with the flight plan data, insert the beacon code in the appropriate field as part of the input message.\nALTRV INFORMATION\nEN ROUTE\nWhen an aircraft is a part of an approved ALTRV, forward only those items necessary to properly identify the flight, update flight data contained in the ALTRV APVL, or revise previously given information.\nCOMPUTER MESSAGE VERIFICATION\nEN ROUTE\nUnless your facility is equipped to automatically obtain acknowledgment of receipt of transferred data, when you transfer control information by computer message, obtain, via Service F, acknowledgment that the receiving center has received the message and verification of the following:\nWithin the time limits specified by a letter of agreement or when not covered by a letter of agreement, at least 15 minutes before the aircraft is estimated to enter the receiving facility's area, or at the time of a radar handoff, or coordination for transfer of control:\nAircraft identification.\nAssigned altitude.\nDeparture or coordination fix time.\nAny cancellation of IFR or EAS generated VFR flight plan.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data.\nTRANSMIT PROPOSED FLIGHT PLAN\nEN ROUTE\nTransmit proposed flight plans which fall within an ARTCC's Proposed Boundary Crossing Time (PBCT) parameter to adjacent ARTCC's via the Computer B network during hours of inter‐center computer operation. In addition, when the route of flight of any proposed flight plan exceeds 20 elements external to the originating ARTCC's area, NADIN must be used to forward the data to all affected centers.\nDuring nonautomated operation, the proposed flight plans must be sent via NADIN to the other centers involved when any of the following conditions are met:\nThe route of flight external to the originating center's area consists of 10 or more elements and the flight will enter 3 or more other center areas.\nNOTE-\nAn element is defined as either a fix or route as specified in FAA Order JO 7110.10, Flight Services, paragraph 6-2-3, Control Messages.\nThe route of flight beyond the first point of exit from the originating center's area consists of 10 or more elements, which are primarily fixes described in fix‐radial‐distance or latitude/longitude format, regardless of the number of other center areas entered.\nThe flight plan remarks are too lengthy for interphone transmission.\nFORWARDING AMENDED AND UTM DATA\nForward any amending data concerning previously forwarded flight plans except that revisions to ETA information in paragraph 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data, need only be forwarded when the time differs by more than 3 minutes from the estimate given.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification), REVISED (revised information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Two, revised flight level, three three zero.”\n“United Eight Ten, revised estimate, Front Royal two zero zero five.”\n“Douglas Five Zero One Romeo, revised altitude, eight thousand.”\n“U.S. Air Eleven Fifty-one, revised type, heavy Boeing Seven Sixty‐seven.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data.\nComputer acceptance of an appropriate input message fulfills the requirement for sending amended data. During EAS FDP operations, the amendment data are considered acknowledged on receipt of a computer update message or a computer-generated flight progress strip containing the amended data.\nNOTE-\nThe successful utilization of automation equipment requires timely and accurate insertion of changes and/or new data.\nIf a pilot is not issued a computer‐generated ADR/ADAR/AAR and if amendment data is not entered into the computer, the next controller will have incorrect route information.\nForward any amended control information and record the action on the appropriate flight progress strip. Additionally, when a route or altitude in a previously issued clearance is amended within 30 minutes of an aircraft's proposed departure time, the facility that amended the clearance must coordinate the amendment with the receiving facility via verbal AND automated means to ensure timely passage of the information. If the automated means of coordination are unavailable, then verbal coordination is sufficient.\nNOTE-\nThe term “receiving” facility means the ATC facility that is expected to transmit the amended clearance to the intended aircraft/pilot.\nEN ROUTE. Effect manual coordination on any interfacility flight plan data that is not passed through automated means.\nEN ROUTE. When a controller receives a UTM notification to an FDIO only facility, they must effect manual coordination for the flight plan data.  In addition, the controller must verify the flight plan data to the receiving facility within three minutes of the transfer of control point estimate.\nNOTE-\nFDIO only facilities are facilities with FDIO but without STARS.\nAIRBORNE MILITARY FLIGHTS\nForward to FSSs the following information received from airborne military aircraft:\nIFR flight plans and changes from VFR to IFR flight plans.\nChanges to an IFR flight plan as follows:\nChange in destination:\nAircraft identification and type.\nDeparture point.\nOriginal destination.\nPosition and time.\nNew destination.\nETA.\nRemarks including change in fuel exhaustion time.\nRevised ETA.\nChange in fuel exhaustion time.\nNOTE-\nThis makes current information available to FSSs for relay to military bases concerned and for use by centers in the event of two-way radio communications failure.\nFORWARDING FLIGHT PLAN DATA BETWEEN U.S. ARTCCs AND CANADIAN ACCs\nEN ROUTE\nDomestic. (Continental U.S./Canadian airspace except Alaska) Proposed departure flight plans and en route estimates will be handled on a 30 minute lead time (or as bilaterally agreed) between any ACC and ARTCC.\nInternational. Any route changes (except SIDs) must be forwarded to the appropriate Oceanic/Pre‐oceanic ACC or ARTCC with an optimum lead time of 30 minutes or as soon as this information becomes available.\nInitially, if a flight goes from U.S. airspace into Canadian airspace and returns to U.S. airspace, the ACC will be responsible for forwarding the flight plan data to the appropriate ARTCC by voice transmission except for flights which traverse mutually agreed on airways/fixes. These airways/fixes will be determined on a case‐by‐case basis and will be based on time and distance considerations at the service area office.\nTELETYPE FLIGHT DATA FORMAT- U.S. ARTCCs - CANADIAN ACCs\nEN ROUTE\nThe exchange of flight plan data between Canadian ACCs and U.S. ARTCCs must be made as follows:\nThe U.S. ARTCCs will transmit flight data to the Canadian ACCs in one of the following formats:\nNADIN II input format as described in the NAS Management Directives (MDs) for:\nFlight Plan Messages:\nActive.\nProposed.\nAmendment messages.\nCancellation messages.\nResponse Messages to Canadian Input:\nAcknowledgment messages.\nError messages.\nRejection messages.\nTransport Canada (TC) ACC Flight Strip Format: Where the data to be printed on the ACC strip form exceeds the strip form field size, the NADIN II input format in 1 above will be used. Input sequentially fields 1 through 8 in paragraph 2-2-6, IFR Flight Progress Data, subparagraph a.\nTC's ACCs will transmit flight data to the FAA ARTCCs in the following format:\nNADIN II input format as described in NAS MDs for:\nFlight Plan Messages:\nActive.\nProposed.\nAmendment messages.\nCancellation messages.\nCorrection messages.\nNORTH AMERICAN ROUTE PROGRAM (NRP) INFORMATION\n“NRP” must be retained in the remarks section of the flight plan if the aircraft is moved due to weather, traffic, or other tactical reasons.\nNOTE-\nEvery effort should be made to ensure the aircraft is returned to the original filed flight plan/altitude as soon as conditions warrant.\nIf the route of flight is altered due to a pilot request, “NRP” must be removed from the remarks section of the flight plan.\n“NRP” must not be entered in the remarks section of a flight plan, unless prior coordination is accomplished with the ATCSCC or as prescribed by international NRP flight operations procedures.\nThe en route facility within which an international flight entering the conterminous U.S. requests to participate in the NRP must enter “NRP” in the remarks section of the flight plan.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 18, Section 17, North American Route Program.",

Flight Progress StripsGENERAL\nUnless otherwise authorized in a facility directive, use flight progress strips to post current data on air traffic and clearances required for control and other air traffic control services. To prevent misinterpretation when data is hand printed, use standard hand‐printed characters.\nEn route: Flight progress strips must be posted.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 6-1-6, Flight Progress Strip Usage.\nMaintain only necessary current data and remove the strips from the flight progress boards when no longer required for control purposes. To correct, update, or preplan information:\nDo not erase or overwrite any item. Use an “X” to delete a climb/descend and maintain arrow, an at or above/below symbol, a cruise symbol, and unwanted altitude information. Write the new altitude information immediately adjacent to it and within the same space.\nDo not draw a horizontal line through an altitude being vacated until after the aircraft has reported or is observed (valid Mode C) leaving the altitude.\nPreplanning may be accomplished in red pencil.\nManually prepared strips must conform to the format of machine‐generated strips and manual strip preparation procedures will be modified simultaneously with the operational implementation of changes in the machine‐generated format. (See FIG 2-3-1.)\nAltitude information may be written in thousands of feet provided the procedure is authorized by the facility manager, and is defined in a facility directive, i.e., 5,000 feet as 5, and 2,800 as 2.8.\nNOTE-\nA slant line crossing through the number zero and underline of the letter “s” on handwritten portions of flight progress strips are required only when there is reason to believe the lack of these markings could lead to misunderstanding.

Approved special use identifiers.\nAIRCRAFT TYPE\nUse the approved aircraft type designator, in accordance with FAA Order 7360.1, Aircraft Type Designators.\nUSAF/USN UNDERGRADUATE PILOTS\nTo identify aircraft piloted by solo USAF/USN undergraduate student pilots (who may occasionally request revised clearances because they normally are restricted to flight in VFR conditions), the aircraft identification in the flight plan must include the letter “Z” as a suffix. Do not use this suffix, however, in ground‐to‐air communication.\nNOTE-\nUSAF solo students who have passed an instrument certification check may penetrate cloud layers in climb or descent only. Requests for revised clearances to avoid clouds in level flight can still be expected. This does not change the requirement to use the letter “Z” as a suffix to the aircraft identification.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 2, USAF Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT)/Pilot Instructor Training (PIT)/Introduction To Fighter Fundamentals.\nAIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT SUFFIX\nThe aircraft equipment suffix identifying communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) capability is generated by automation using the equipment codes of the ICAO flight plan. To change a suffix, the CNS equipment codes must be modified, allowing automation to translate them into the proper suffix. If using unsupported automation platforms (OFDPS and FDP2000), verbally coordinate changes with adjacent supported facilities.\nERAM and ATOP are best suited for making changes to the equipment codes in an ICAO flight plan. For FDIO entries, if uncertain of the proper format to correctly amend an equipment code, verbally coordinate the change with the appropriate en route facility.\nNOTE-\nDirectly changing the equipment suffix with a symbol preceded by a slant instead of amending the aircraft equipment codes may unintentionally alter or delete other equipment codes.\nFor VFR operations, indicate the aircraft's transponder and navigation capabilities by adding the appropriate symbol, preceded by a slant (See TBL 2-3-10).\nGNSS-equipped aircraft:\nHave an equipment suffix of /G, /L, /S, or /V.\nMay be determined by executing an ICAO flight plan readout and verifying a filed “G” in the ICAO equipment list.\nMay be determined by verifying with the pilot that the aircraft is GNSS-equipped.\nWhen forwarding this information, state the aircraft type followed by the word “slant” and the appropriate phonetic letter equivalent of the suffix.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cessna Three-ten slant Tango.”\n“A-Ten slant November.”\n“F-Sixteen slant Papa.”\n“Seven-sixty-seven slant Golf.”\nNOTE-\n/H and /O are intended for ATC use only. These suffixes are not published in the Aeronautical Information Manual.\nCLEARANCE STATUS\nUse an appropriate clearance symbol followed by a dash (-) and other pertinent information to clearly show the clearance status of an aircraft. To indicate delay status use:\nThe symbol “H” at the clearance limit when holding instructions have been included in the aircraft's original clearance. Show detailed holding information following the dash when holding differs from the established pattern for the fix; i.e., turns, leg lengths, etc.\nThe symbols “F” or “O” to indicate the clearance limit when a delay is not anticipated.\nTBL 2-3-10Aircraft Equipment Suffixes\nSeparation Standard\nNavigation Capability\nTransponder Capability\nSuffix\nRVSM\nAny\nFailed transponder\n/H\nAny\nFailed Mode C\n/O\nNo RNAV, No GNSS\nTransponder with Mode C\n/W\nRNAV, No GNSS\nTransponder with Mode C\n/Z\nGNSS\nTransponder with Mode C\n/L\nNon-RVSM\nNo DME\nNo transponder\n/X\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/T\nTransponder with Mode C\n/U\nDME\nNo transponder\n/D\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/B\nTransponder with Mode C\n/A\nTACAN\nNo transponder\n/M\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/N\nTransponder with Mode C\n/P\nRNAV,\nNo GNSS\nNo transponder\n/Y\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/C\nTransponder with Mode C\n/I\nGNSS\nNo transponder\n/V\nTransponder, no Mode C\n/S\nTransponder with Mode C\n/G\nCONTROL SYMBOLOGY\nUse authorized control and clearance symbols or abbreviations for recording clearances, reports, and instructions. Control status of aircraft must always be current. You may use:\nPlain language markings when it will aid in understanding information.\nLocally approved identifiers. Use these only within your facility and not on teletypewriter or interphone circuits.\nPlain sheets of paper or locally prepared forms to record information when flight progress strips are not used.

    "content": "General ControlRadio and Interphone Communications\nSection 4. Radio and Interphone CommunicationsRADIO COMMUNICATIONS\nUse radio frequencies for the special purposes for which they are intended. A single frequency may be used for more than one function except as follows:\nTERMINAL. When combining positions in the tower, do not use ground control frequency for airborne communications.\nNOTE-\nDue to the limited number of frequencies assigned to towers for the ground control function, it is very likely that airborne use of a ground control frequency could cause interference to other towers or interference to your aircraft from another tower. When combining these functions, it is recommended combining them on local control. The ATIS may be used to specify the desired frequency.\nMONITORING\nMonitor interphones and assigned radio frequencies continuously.\nNOTE-\nAlthough all FAA facilities, including RAPCONs and RATCFs, are required to monitor all assigned frequencies continuously, USAF facilities may not monitor all unpublished discrete frequencies.\nPILOT ACKNOWLEDGMENT/READ BACK\nEnsure pilots acknowledge all Air Traffic Clearances and ATC Instructions. When a pilot reads back an Air Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction:\nEnsure that items read back are correct.\nEnsure the read back of hold short instructions, whether a part of taxi instructions or a LAHSO clearance.\nEnsure pilots use call signs and/or registration numbers in any read back acknowledging an Air Traffic Clearance or ATC Instruction.\nNOTE-\nATC Clearance/Instruction Read Back guidance for pilots in the AIM states:\nAlthough pilots should read back the “numbers,” unless otherwise required by procedure or controller request, pilots may acknowledge clearances, control instructions, or other information by using “Wilco,” “Roger,” “Affirmative,” or other words or remarks with their aircraft identification.\nAltitudes contained in charted procedures, such as departure procedures, instrument approaches, etc., need not be read back unless they are specifically stated by the controller.\nInitial read back of a taxi, departure or landing clearance should include the runway assignment, including left, right, center, etc. if applicable.\nUntil a pilot acknowledges a controller's clearance or instruction, a controller cannot know if a pilot will comply with the clearance or remain as previously cleared.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Climbing to Flight Level three three zero, United Twelve” or “November Five Charlie Tango, roger, cleared to land runway four left.”\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - AIR TRAFFIC CLEARANCE.\nP/CG Term - ATC INSTRUCTIONS.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-4-4, Communications Failure.\nAIM, Para 4-2-3, Contact Procedures.\nAIM, Para 4-4-7, Pilot Responsibility upon Clearance Issuance.\nAIM, Para 6-4-1, Two-way Radio Communications Failure.\nFederal Register, April 1, 1999 14 CFR Part 91, Pilot Responsibility for Compliance with ATC Clearances and Instructions.\nAUTHORIZED INTERRUPTIONS\nAs necessary, authorize a pilot to interrupt his/her communications guard.\nNOTE-\nSome users have adopted procedures to ensure uninterrupted receiving capability with ATC when a pilot with only one operative communications radio must interrupt his/her communications guard because of a safety related problem requiring airborne communications with his/her company. In this event, pilots will request approval to abandon guard on the assigned ATC frequency for a mutually agreeable time period. Additionally, they will inform controllers of the NAVAID voice facility and the company frequency they will monitor.\nAUTHORIZED TRANSMISSIONS\nTransmit only those messages necessary for air traffic control or otherwise contributing to air safety.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-2-2, Authorized Messages Not Directly Associated with Air Traffic Services.\nFALSE OR DECEPTIVE COMMUNICATIONS\nTake action to detect, prevent, and report false, deceptive, or phantom controller communications to an aircraft or controller. The following must be accomplished when false or deceptive communications occur:\nCorrect false information.\nBroadcast an alert to aircraft operating on all frequencies within the area where deceptive or phantom transmissions have been received.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft. False ATC instructions have been received in the area of Long Beach Airport. Exercise extreme caution on all frequencies and verify instructions.”\nCollect pertinent information regarding the incident.\nNotify the operations supervisor of the false, deceptive, or phantom transmission and report all relevant information pertaining to the incident.\nAUTHORIZED RELAYS\nRelay operational information to aircraft or aircraft operators as necessary. Do not agree to handle such messages on a regular basis. Give the source of any such message you relay.\nRelay official FAA messages as required.\nNOTE-\nThe FAA Administrator and Deputy Administrator will sometimes use code phrases to identify themselves in air‐to‐ground communications as follows:\nAdministrator: “SAFEAIR ONE.”\nDeputy Administrator: “SAFEAIR TWO.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Miami Center, Jetstar One, this is SAFEAIR ONE, (message).”\nRelay operational information to military aircraft  operating on, or planning to operate on IRs.\nRADIO MESSAGE FORMAT\nUse the following format for radio communications  with an aircraft:\nSector/position on initial radio contact:\nIdentification of aircraft.\nIdentification of ATC unit.\nMessage (if any).\nThe word “over” if required.\nSubsequent radio transmissions from the same sector/position must use the same format, except the identification of the ATC unit may be omitted.\nTERMINAL. You may omit aircraft identification after initial contact when conducting the final portion of a radar approach.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nABBREVIATED TRANSMISSIONS\nTransmissions may be abbreviated as follows:\nUse the identification prefix and the last 3 digits or letters of the aircraft identification after communications have been established with a U.S. civil aircraft using the aircraft registration as identification.\nDo not abbreviate:\nSimilar sounding aircraft identifications.\nAircraft call signs, including:\nAircraft having an International Civil Aviation Organization three letter designator (ICAO 3LD) and other aircraft with an FAA authorized call sign (U.S. special or local).\nAircraft with a military call sign.\nForeign aircraft using the foreign civil registration number as identification.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-15, Emphasis for Clarity.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7610.12, Assignment and Authorization of Call Sign Designators and Associated Telephonies.\nOmit the facility identification after communication has been established.\nTransmit the message immediately after the callup (without waiting for the aircraft's reply) when the message is short and receipt is generally assured.\nOmit the word “over” if the message obviously requires a reply.\nINTERPHONE TRANSMISSION PRIORITIES\nGive priority to interphone transmissions as follows:\nFirst priority. Emergency messages including essential information on aircraft accidents or suspected accidents. After an actual emergency has passed, give a lower priority to messages relating to that accident.\nSecond priority. Clearances and control instructions.\nThird priority. Movement and control messages using the following order of preference when possible:\nProgress reports.\nDeparture or arrival reports.\nFlight plans.\nFourth priority. Movement messages on VFR aircraft.\nPRIORITY INTERRUPTION\nUse the words “emergency” or “control” for interrupting lower priority messages when you have an emergency or control message to transmit.\nINTERPHONE MESSAGE FORMAT\nUse the following format for interphone intra/interfacility communications:\nBoth the caller and receiver identify their facility and/or position in a manner that ensures they will not be confused with another position.\nNOTE-\nOther means of identifying a position, such as substituting departure or arrival gate/fix names for position identification, may be used. However, it must be operationally beneficial, and the procedure fully covered in a letter of agreement or a facility directive, as appropriate.\nEXAMPLE-\nCaller: “Albuquerque Center Sixty Three, Amarillo Departure.”\nReceiver: “Albuquerque Center.”\nBetween two facilities which utilize numeric position identification, the caller must identify both facility and position.\nEXAMPLE-\nCaller: “Albuquerque Sixty Three, Fort Worth Eighty Two.”\nCaller states the type of coordination to be accomplished when advantageous. For example, handoff or APREQ.\nThe caller states the message.\nThe receiver states the response to the caller's message followed by the receiver's operating initials.\nThe caller states his or her operating initials.\nEXAMPLE-\nCaller: “Denver High, R Twenty-five.”\nReceiver: “Denver High.”\nCaller: “Request direct Denver for Northwest Three Twenty-eight.”\nReceiver: “Northwest Three Twenty-eight direct Denver approved. H.F.”\nCaller: “G.M.”\nReceiver: “Denver High, Go ahead override.”\nCaller: “R Twenty-five, Request direct Denver for Northwest Three Twenty-eight.”\nReceiver: “Northwest Three Twenty-eight direct Denver approved. H.F.”\nCaller: “G.M.”\nCaller: (“Bolos” is a departure gate in Houston ARTCC's Sabine sector)-“Bolos, Houston local.”\nReceiver: “Bolos.”\nCaller: “Request Flight Level three five zero for American Twenty-five.”\nReceiver: “American Twenty-five Flight Level three five zero approved, A.C.”\nCaller: “G.M.”\nCaller: “Sector Twelve, Ontario Approach, APREQ.”\nReceiver: “Sector Twelve.”\nCaller: “Cactus Five forty-two heading one three zero and climbing to one four thousand.”\nReceiver: “Cactus Five forty-two heading one three zero and climbing to one four thousand approved. B.N.”\nCaller: “A.M.”\nCaller: “Zanesville, Columbus, seventy-three line, handoff.”\nReceiver: “Zanesville.”\nCaller: “Five miles east of Appleton VOR, United Three Sixty-six.”\nReceiver: “United Three Sixty-six, radar contact, A.Z.”\nCaller: “M.E.”\nIdentify the interphone voice line on which the call is being made when two or more such lines are collocated at the receiving operating position.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Washington Center, Washington Approach on the Fifty Seven line.”\n“Chicago Center, O'Hare Tower handoff on the Departure West line.”\nTERMINAL. The provisions of subparagraphs a, b, c, e, f, g, and paragraph 2-4-13, Interphone Message Termination, may be omitted provided:\nAbbreviated standard coordination procedures are contained in a facility directive describing the specific conditions and positions that may utilize an abbreviated interphone message format; and\nThere will be no possibility of misunderstanding which positions are using the abbreviated procedures.\nINTERPHONE MESSAGE TERMINATION\nTerminate interphone messages with your operating initials.\nWORDS AND PHRASES\nUse the words or phrases in radiotelephone and interphone communication as contained in the P/CG or, within areas where Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) is in use, the phraseology contained in the applicable CPDLC message set.\nThe word super must be used as part of the identification in all communications with or about super aircraft.\nThe word heavy must be used as part of the identification in all communications with or about heavy aircraft.\nEN ROUTE. The use of the words super or heavy may be omitted except as follows:\nIn communications with a terminal facility about super or heavy aircraft operations.\nIn communications with or about super or heavy aircraft with regard to an airport where the en route center is providing approach control service.\nIn communications with or about super or heavy aircraft when the separation from a following aircraft may become less than 5 miles by approved procedure.\nWhen issuing traffic advisories.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Fifty-Eight Heavy.”\nNOTE-\nMost airlines will use the word “super” or “heavy” following the company prefix and flight number when establishing communications or when changing frequencies within a terminal facility's area.\nWhen in radio communications with “Air Force One” or “Air Force Two,” do not add the heavy designator to the call sign. State only the call sign “Air Force One/Two” regardless of the type aircraft.\nEMPHASIS FOR CLARITY\nTreat aircraft with similar sounding aircraft identifications by emphasizing appropriate digits, letters, or similar sounding words to aid in distinguishing between similar sounding aircraft identifications. Do not abbreviate similar sounding aircraft identifications.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-20, Aircraft Identification.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-9, Abbreviated Transmissions.\nTreat aircraft with similar sounding call signs by restating the call sign after the flight number.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Thirty-one United.”\n“American Thirty-one American.”\nNOTE-\nSimilar sounding call signs procedures may apply to ICAO 3LD U.S. special, local, or military call sign.\nNotify each pilot concerned when communicating with aircraft having similar sounding identifications.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Thirty-one United, Miami Center, U.S. Air Thirty-one is also on this frequency, acknowledge.”\n“U.S. Air Thirty-one U.S. Air, Miami Center, United Thirty-one is also on this frequency, acknowledge.”\nNotify the operations supervisor-in-charge of any duplicate call signs or phonetically similar-sounding call signs when the aircraft are operating simultaneously within the same sector.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-14, Aircraft Identification Problems.\nICAO PHONETICS\nUse the ICAO pronunciation of numbers and individual letters.

    "content": "General ControlWeather Information\nSection 6. Weather InformationFAMILIARIZATION\nControllers must become familiar with pertinent weather information when coming on duty, and stay aware of current and forecasted weather information needed to perform ATC duties.\nNOTE-\nEvery phase of flight has the potential to be impacted by weather, and emphasis must be placed on gathering, reporting and disseminating weather information.\nPIREP SOLICITATION AND DISSEMINATION\nEmphasis must be placed on the solicitation and dissemination of Urgent (UUA) and Routine (UA) PIREPs. Timely dissemination of PIREPs alerts pilots to weather conditions and provides information useful to forecasters in the development of aviation forecasts. PIREPs also provide information required by ATC in the provision of safe and efficient use of airspace. This includes reports of strong frontal activity, squall lines, thunderstorms, light to severe icing, wind shear and turbulence (including clear air turbulence) of moderate or greater intensity, braking action, volcanic eruptions and volcanic ash clouds, detection of sulfur gases in the cabin, and other conditions pertinent to flight safety. Controllers must provide the information in sufficient detail to assist pilots in making decisions pertinent to flight safety.\nNOTE-\nRoutine PIREPs indicating a lack of forecasted weather conditions, for example, a lack of icing or turbulence, are also valuable to aviation weather forecasters and pilots. This is especially true when adverse conditions are expected or forecasted but do not develop or no longer exist.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-8, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-4, Braking Action.\nP/CG Term - BRAKING ACTION.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 6-3-1, Handling of SIGMETs, CWAs, and PIREPs.\nAIM, Para 7-5-9, Flight Operations in Volcanic Ash.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-1, Dissemination of Weather Information.FAA Order JO 7110.10, Chapter 8, Section 1, Pilot Weather Reports.\nSolicit PIREPs when requested, deemed necessary or any of the following conditions exists or is forecast for your area of jurisdiction:\nCeilings at or below 5,000 feet. These PIREPs must include cloud bases, tops and cloud coverage when available. Additionally, when providing approach control services, ensure that at least one descent/climb-out PIREP and other related phenomena is obtained each hour.\nVisibility (surface or aloft) at or less than 5 miles.\nThunderstorms and related phenomena.\nTurbulence of moderate degree or greater.\nIcing of light degree or greater.\nWind shear.\nBraking action reports less than good.\nVolcanic ash clouds.\nDetection of sulfur gases (SO2 or H2S), associated with volcanic activity, in the cabin.\nNOTE-\nThe smell of sulfur gases in the cockpit may indicate volcanic activity that has not yet been detected or reported and/or possible entry into an ash‐bearing cloud. SO2 is identifiable as the sharp, acrid odor of a freshly struck match. H2S has the odor of rotten eggs.\nPilots may forward PIREPs regarding volcanic activity using the format described in the Volcanic Activity Reporting Form (VAR) as depicted in the AIM, Appendix 2.\nCategorize PIREPs as follows:\nURGENT. The following weather phenomena must be classified as an URGENT PIREP (UUA):\nTornadoes, funnel clouds, or waterspouts.\nSevere or extreme turbulence (including clear air turbulence).\nSevere icing.\nHail.\nLow‐level wind shear (LLWS). For the safety of light aircraft, classify low‐level wind shear PIREPs as UUA if the pilot reports airspeed fluctuations of 10 knots or more. Classify reports of low‐level wind shear with airspeed fluctuations less than 10 knots as routine. If airspeed fluctuation is not reported, classify PIREP as UUA.\nNOTE-\nLow‐level wind shear is defined as wind shear within 2,000 feet of the surface.\nVolcanic eruption, ash clouds, and/or detection of sulfur gases (H2S or SO2) in the cabin, however, if a pilot only reported the smell of H2S or SO2 in the cabin and confirmed no volcanic ash clouds were present, classify the report as a ROUTINE PIREP.\nAny other weather phenomena reported which in your opinion may be hazardous, or potentially hazardous, to flight operations.\nROUTINE. Classify as ROUTINE (UA) all PIREPs received except those listed above.\nRecord with the PIREPs:\nTime.\nAircraft position.\nType aircraft.\nAltitude or range of altitudes.\nWhen the PIREP involves turbulence, include:\nDuration (occasional, intermittent, or continuous).\nIntensity (light, moderate, severe, or extreme).\nNOTE-\nThe duration and intensity of turbulence is determined by the pilot.\nWhen the PIREP involves icing, include:\nIcing type and intensity (trace, light, moderate, or severe).\nAir temperature in which icing is occurring.\nObtain PIREPs directly from the pilot, or if the PIREP has been requested by another facility, you may instruct the pilot to deliver it directly to that facility.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREQUEST/SAY FLIGHT CONDITIONS. Or if appropriate,\nREQUEST/SAY (specific conditions; i.e., ride, cloud, visibility, etc.) CONDITIONS.\nIf necessary,\nOVER (fix),\nor\nALONG PRESENT ROUTE,\nor\nBETWEEN (fix) AND (fix).\nDisseminate PIREPs as follows:\nRelay pertinent PIREP information to concerned aircraft in a timely manner.\nNOTE-\nUse the word gain and/or loss when describing to pilots the effects of wind shear on airspeed.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Delta Seven Twenty-one, a Boeing Seven Thirty-seven, previously reported wind shear, loss of two five knots at four hundred feet.”\n“Alaska One, a Boeing Seven Thirty-seven, previously reported wind shear, gain of two-five knots between niner hundred and six hundred feet, followed by a loss of five zero knots between five hundred feet and the surface.”\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Para 7-1-22, Wind Shear PIREPs.\nEN ROUTE.

Errors in weather radar presentation must be reported to the technical operations technician and the air traffic supervisor must determine if the digitized radar derived weather data is to be displayed and a NOTAM distributed.\nNOTE-\nAnomalous propagation (AP) is a natural occurrence affecting radar and does not in itself constitute a weather circuit failure.\nDISSEMINATING OFFICIAL WEATHER INFORMATION\nTERMINAL. Observed elements of weather information must be disseminated as follows:\nGeneral weather information, such as “large breaks in the overcast,” “visibility lowering to the south,” or similar statements which do not include specific values, and any elements derived directly from instruments, pilots, or radar may be transmitted to pilots or other ATC facilities without consulting the weather reporting station.\nSpecific values, such as ceiling and visibility, may be transmitted if obtained by one of the following means:\nYou are properly certificated and acting as official weather observer for the elements being reported.\nNOTE-\nUSAF controllers do not serve as official weather observers.\nYou have obtained the information from the official observer for the elements being reported.\nThe weather report was composed or verified by the weather station.\nThe information is obtained from a FAA approved automation surface weather system.\nDifferences between weather elements observed from the tower and those reported by the weather station must be reported to the official observer for the element concerned.\nHAZARDOUS INFLIGHT WEATHER ADVISORY\nControllers must advise pilots of hazardous weather that may impact operations within 150 NM of their sector or area of jurisdiction. Hazardous weather information contained in the advisories includes Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) (except over the CONUS), Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET), Convective SIGMET (WST), Urgent Pilot Weather Reports (UUA), and Center Weather Advisories (CWA).

However, issuance of the setting of an adjacent station during periods that a steep gradient exists will serve to inform the pilot of the difference between the setting he/she is using and the pressure in the local area and better enable him/her to choose a more advantageous setting within the limitations of 14 CFR section 91.121.\nTERMINAL.

The altimeter setting does not directly affect the transponder reported altitude. ATC automation applies the current altimeter setting to the pressure altitude received and displays the altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level (MSL).\nWith a barometric pressure of 31.30” Hg and the aircraft's altimeter set at 31.00” Hg, the Mode C transponder will transmit the actual altitude of 3,300, feet while the altimeter only shows 3,000 feet. This will occur unless local directives authorize entering the altimeter setting 31.00” Hg into the ATC automation regardless of the actual barometric pressure.\nAirports unable to accurately measure barometric pressures above 31.00” Hg. will report the barometric pressure as “missing” or “in excess of 31.00” Hg.” Flight operations to or from those airports are restricted to VFR weather conditions.",

Identify the first resumed broadcast message with “Alpha” or the first assigned alphabet letter word in the event of a broadcast interruption of more than 12 hours.\nSpecific sequential portions of the alphabet may be assigned between facilities or an arrival and departure ATIS when designated by a letter of agreement or facility directive.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-4-1, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).\nThe ATIS recording must be reviewed for completeness, accuracy, speech rate, and proper enunciation before being transmitted.\nArrival and departure messages, when broadcast separately, need only contain information appropriate for that operation.\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nMaintain an ATIS message that reflects the most current arrival and departure information.\nMake a new recording when any of the following occur:\nUpon receipt of any new official weather regardless of whether there is or is not a change in values.\nWhen runway braking action reports are received that indicate runway braking is worse than that which is included in the current ATIS broadcast.\nWhen there is a change in any other pertinent data, such as runway change, instrument approach in use, new or canceled NOTAMs/PIREPs update, etc.\nWhen a pilot acknowledges that he/she has received the ATIS broadcast, controllers may omit those items contained in the broadcasts if they are current. Rapidly changing conditions will be issued by ATC, and the ATIS will contain the following:\nEXAMPLE-\n“Latest ceiling/visibility/altimeter/wind/(other conditions) will be issued by approach control/tower.”\nControllers must ensure that pilots receive the most current pertinent information by taking the following actions, as applicable:\nWhen a pilot does not state the appropriate ATIS code on initial contact, ask the pilot to confirm receipt of the current ATIS information.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Verify you have information CHARLIE.”\n“Information CHARLIE current. Advise when you have CHARLIE.”\nWhen a pilot is unable to receive the ATIS, issue the current weather, runway in use, approach/departure information, pertinent NOTAMs, and airport conditions.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Wind two five zero at one zero. Visibility one zero. Ceiling four thousand five hundred broken. Temperature three four. Dew point two eight. Altimeter three zero one zero. ILS-DME Runway Two Seven Approach in use. Departing Runway Two Two Right. Hazardous Weather Information for (geographical area) available on Flight Service Frequencies. Braking Action advisories are in effect.”\nAdvise aircraft of changes to the ATIS code by broadcasting the change on all appropriate frequencies. The broadcast must include changes to pertinent operational information, when known, that necessitated the ATIS change.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Attention all aircraft, information ALPHA current.”\n“Attention all aircraft, information BRAVO current. MICROBURST advisories in effect.”\n“Attention all aircraft, information CHARLIE current. Numerous flocks of ducks in the immediate vicinity of (name) airport, altitude unknown.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nNOTE-\nNo additional acknowledgement is required when a controller broadcasts information subsequent to the pilot's initial acknowledgement of the ATIS. Requiring each aircraft to acknowledge receipt of pertinent changes (broadcast) after initial confirmation of the ATIS could significantly impact workload.\nPertinent conditions are those that have a clear decisive relevance to the safety of air traffic. As noted in paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority, there are many variables involved that make it virtually impossible to develop a standard list of changes that are classified as relevant to every conceivable situation. Each set of circumstances must be evaluated on its own merit, and when more than one action is required, controllers must exercise their best judgment based on the facts and circumstances known to them.\nCONTENT\nInclude the following in ATIS broadcast as appropriate:\nAirport/facility name.\nPhonetic letter code.\nTime of the latest weather sequence (UTC).\nWeather information consisting of:\nWind direction and velocity.\nVisibility.\nObstructions to vision.\nPresent weather consisting of: sky condition, temperature, dew point, altimeter, a density altitude advisory when appropriate, and other pertinent remarks included in the official weather observation. Always include weather observation remarks of lightning, cumulonimbus, and towering cumulus clouds.\nNOTE-\nASOS/AWOS is to be considered the primary source of wind direction, velocity, and altimeter data for weather observation purposes at those locations that are so equipped. The ASOS Operator Interface Device (OID) displays the magnetic wind as “MAG WND” in the auxiliary data location in the lower left-hand portion of the screen. Other OID displayed winds are true and are not to be used for operational purposes.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7900.5, Surface Weather Observing Table 3-2.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-2-1, Position Duties and Responsibilities.\nInstrument approach and runway in use.\nMan-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) alert and advisory. Specify the nature and location of threat or incident, whether reported or observed and by whom, time (if known), and notification to pilots to advise ATC if they need to divert.\nEXAMPLE-\n“MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS threat reported by TSA, Chicago area.” “Advise on initial contact if you want to divert.”\n“MANPADS alert. Exercise extreme caution. MANPADS attack observed by tower one-half mile northwest of airfield at one-two-five-zero Zulu.” “Advise on initial contact if you want to divert.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-13, MANPADS Alert.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-10, Handling MANPADS Incidents.\nTerminal facilities must include reported unauthorized laser illumination events on the ATIS broadcast for one hour following the last report. Include the time, location, altitude, color, and direction of the laser as reported by the pilot.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION EVENT, (UTC time), (location), (altitude), (color), (direction).\nEXAMPLE-\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION EVENT, AT 0100z, 8 MILE FINAL RUNWAY 18R AT 3,000 FEET, GREEN LASER FROM THE SOUTHWEST.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-14, Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-30, Reporting Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\nThe ceiling/sky condition, visibility, and obstructions to vision may be omitted if the ceiling is above 5,000 feet and the visibility is more than 5 miles.\nEXAMPLE-\nA remark may be made, “The weather is better than five thousand and five.”\nInstrument/visual approach/es in use. Specify landing runway/s unless the runway is that to which the instrument approach is made. Before advertising non-precision approaches, priority should be given to available precision, then APV approaches.\nDeparture runway/s (to be given only if different from landing runway/s or in the instance of a “departure only” ATIS).\nTaxiway closures which affect the entrance or exit of active runways, other closures which impact airport operations, other NOTAMs and PIREPs pertinent to operations in the terminal area. Inform pilots of where hazardous weather is occurring and how the information may be obtained. Include available information of known bird activity.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, 2-1-23, Bird Activity Information.\nWhen a runway length has been temporarily or permanently shortened, ensure that the word “WARNING” prefaces the runway number, and that the word “shortened” is also included in the text of the message.\nAvailable runway length, as stated in the NOTAM, must be included in the ATIS broadcast.  This information must be broadcast for the duration of the construction project.\nFor permanently shortened runways, facilities must continue to broadcast this information for a minimum of 30 days or until the Chart Supplement has been updated, whichever is longer.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nWARNING, RUNWAY (number) HAS BEEN SHORTENED, (length in feet) FEET AVAILABLE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Warning, Runway One-Zero has been shortened, niner-thousand eight hundred and fifty feet available.”\nRunway Condition Codes (RwyCC) when provided. Include the time of the report.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) condition codes (first value, second value, third value) AT (time),\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two Seven, condition codes two, two, one at one zero one eight Zulu.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-1, Landing Area Condition.\nRunway Condition Codes “3/3/3” and the statement “Slippery When Wet.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway (number) condition codes three, three, three, Slippery When Wet at one two five five Zulu.”\nNOTE-\nA Slippery When Wet FICON NOTAM indicates a runway has failed a friction survey, for example, due to excessive rubber build-up. Airport Operators will notify ATCT operational personnel of this concern and issue a FICON NOTAM prior to the expected arrival of rain. The FICON NOTAM will be canceled when the rain has ended and the runway environment is determined to be dry by the Airport Operator.\nRunway Condition codes “X/X/X.” When a FICON NOTAM indicates these values, the statement “Runway Condition Codes Missing” must be included on the ATIS broadcast.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway (number) condition codes missing at one three four seven Zulu.”\nNOTE-\nA FICON NOTAM may be generated with “X/X/X” instead of Runway Condition Codes. This will occur when the NOTAM user interface is not functioning correctly; however, a FICON NOTAM is still present.\nOther optional information as local conditions dictate in coordination with ATC. This may include such items as VFR arrival frequencies, temporary airport conditions, LAHSO operations being con-ducted, or other perishable items that may appear only for a matter of hours or a few days on the ATIS message.\nWhen all 3 runway segments (touchdown, midpoint, and rollout) are reporting a code of 6, the Airport Operator will notify ATC that runway condition codes are no longer reportable.\nLow level wind shear/microburst when reported by pilots or is detected on a wind shear detection system.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-8, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories.\nA statement which advises the pilot to read back instructions to hold short of a runway. The air traffic manager may elect to remove this requirement 60 days after implementation provided that removing the statement from the ATIS does not result in increased requests from aircraft for read back of hold short instructions.\nInstructions for the pilot to acknowledge receipt of the ATIS message by informing the controller on initial contact.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Boston Tower Information Delta. One four zero zero Zulu. Wind two five zero at one zero. Visibility one zero. Ceiling four thousand five hundred broken. Temperature three four. Dew point two eight. Altimeter three zero one zero. ILS-DME Runway Two Seven Approach in use. Departing Runway Two Two Right. Hazardous Weather Information for (geographical area) available on Flight Service Frequencies. Advise on initial contact you have Delta.”",

Caution wake turbulence.\"\nWhen using a CTRD, you may issue traffic advisories using the standard radar phraseology prescribed in paragraph 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nPOSITION DETERMINATION\nDetermine the position of an aircraft, personnel or equipment before issuing taxi instructions, takeoff clearance, or authorizing personnel, and/or equipment to proceed onto the movement area.\nNOTE-\nWhen possible, positions of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and/or personnel may be determined visually or through use of a display system.  When ATC is unable to determine position visually or via a display system, position reports may be used.\nLOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ADVISORIES\nWhen low level wind shear/microburst is reported by pilots, Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS), or detected on wind shear detection systems such as LLWAS NE++, LLWAS-RS, WSP, or TDWR, controllers must issue the alert to all arriving and departing aircraft. Continue the alert to aircraft until it is broadcast on the ATIS and pilots indicate they have received the appropriate ATIS code. A statement must be included on the ATIS for 20 minutes following the last report or indication of the wind shear/microburst.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nLOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR (or MICROBURST, as appropriate) ADVISORIES IN EFFECT.\nNOTE-\nSome aircraft are equipped with Predictive Wind Shear (PWS) alert systems that warn the flight crew of a potential wind shear up to 3 miles ahead and 25 degrees either side of the aircraft heading at or below 1200' AGL. Pilot reports may include warnings received from PWS systems.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-2, PIREP Solicitation and Dissemination.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-1, Landing Information.\nAt facilities without ATIS, ensure that wind shear/microburst information is broadcast to all arriving and departing aircraft for 20 minutes following the last report or indication of wind shear/microburst.\nApply the following procedures and phraseology for the depicted wind shear detection system described below.\nAt locations equipped with LLWAS, the local controller must provide wind information as follows:\nNOTE-\nThe LLWAS is designed to detect low level wind shear conditions around the periphery of an airport. It does not detect wind shear beyond that limitation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-3, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Detection Systems.\nIf an alert is received, issue the airport wind and the displayed field boundary wind.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nWIND SHEAR ALERT. AIRPORT WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (Location of sensor) BOUNDARY WIND (direction) AT (velocity).\nIf multiple alerts are received, issue an advisory that there are wind shear alerts in two/several/all quadrants. After issuing the advisory, issue the airport wind in accordance with paragraph 3-9-1, Departure Information, followed by the field boundary wind most appropriate to the aircraft operation.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nWIND SHEAR ALERTS TWO/SEVERAL/ALL QUADRANTS. AIRPORT WIND (direction) AT (velocity). (Location of sensor) BOUNDARY WIND (direction) AT (velocity).\nIf requested by the pilot, issue specific field boundary wind information even though the LLWAS may not be in alert status.\nNOTE-\nThe requirements for issuance of wind information remain valid as appropriate under this paragraph, paragraph 3-9-1, Departure Information, and paragraph 3-10-1, Landing Information.\nWind shear detection systems, including TDWR, WSP, LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS-RS provide the capability of displaying microburst alerts, wind shear alerts, and wind information oriented to the threshold or departure end of a runway. When detected, the associated ribbon display allows the controller to read the displayed alert without any need for interpretation.\nIf a wind shear or microburst alert is received for the runway in use, issue the alert information for that runway to arriving and departing aircraft as it is displayed on the ribbon display.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Runway) (arrival/departure) WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ALERT, (windspeed) KNOT GAIN/LOSS, (location).\nEXAMPLE-\n17A MBA 40K - 3MF\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY 17 ARRIVAL MICROBURST ALERT 40 KNOT LOSS 3 MILE FINAL.\nEXAMPLE-\n17D WSA 25K+ 2MD\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY 17 DEPARTURE WIND SHEAR ALERT 25 KNOT GAIN 2 MILE DEPARTURE.\nIf requested by the pilot or deemed appropriate by the controller, issue the displayed wind information oriented to the threshold or departure end of the runway.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Runway) DEPARTURE/THRESHOLD WIND (direction) AT (velocity).\nLLWAS NE++ or LLWAS-RS may detect a possible wind shear/microburst at the edge of the system but may be unable to distinguish between a wind shear and a microburst. A wind shear alert message will be displayed, followed by an asterisk, advising of a possible wind shear outside of the system network.\nNOTE-\nLLWAS NE++ when associated with TDWR can detect wind shear/microbursts outside the network if the TDWR fails.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Appropriate wind or alert information) POSSIBLE WIND SHEAR OUTSIDE THE NETWORK.\nIf unstable conditions produce multiple alerts, issue an advisory of multiple wind shear/microburst alerts followed by specific alert or wind information most appropriate to the aircraft operation.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nMULTIPLE WIND SHEAR/MICROBURST ALERTS (specific alert or wind information).\nThe LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS-RS are designed to operate with as many as 50 percent of the total sensors inoperative. When all three remote sensors designated for a specific runway arrival or departure wind display line are inoperative then the LLWAS NE++ and LLWAS-RS for that runway arrival/departure must be considered out of service. When a specific runway arrival or departure wind display line is inoperative and wind shear/microburst activity is likely; (for example, frontal activity, convective storms, PIREPs), the following statement must be included on the ATIS, “WIND SHEAR AND MICROBURST INFORMATION FOR RUNWAY (runway number) ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE NOT AVAILABLE.”\nNOTE-\nThe geographic situation display (GSD) is a supervisory planning tool and is not intended to be a primary tool for microburst or wind shear.\nWind Shear Escape Procedures.\nIf an aircraft under your control informs you that it is performing a wind shear escape, do not issue control instructions that are contrary to pilot actions.  ATC should continue to provide safety alerts regarding terrain or obstacles and traffic advisories for the escape aircraft, as appropriate.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Denver Tower, United 1154, wind shear escape.”\nNOTE-\nAircraft that execute a wind shear escape maneuver will usually conduct a full power climb straight ahead and will not accept any control instructions until onboard systems advise the crew or the pilot in command (PIC) advises ATC that the escape maneuver is no longer required.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - WIND SHEAR ESCAPE.\nUnless advised by additional aircraft that they are also performing an escape procedure, do not presume that other aircraft in the proximity of the escape aircraft are responding to wind shear alerts/events as well. Continue to provide control instructions, safety alerts, and traffic advisories, as appropriate.\nOnce the responding aircraft has initiated a wind shear escape maneuver, the controller is not responsible for providing approved separation between the aircraft that is responding to an escape and any other aircraft, airspace, terrain, or obstacle. Responsibility for approved separation resumes when one of the following conditions is met:\nDepartures:\nA crew member informs ATC that the wind shear escape maneuver is complete and ATC observes that approved separation has been re-established, or\nA crew member informs ATC that the escape maneuver is complete and has resumed a previously assigned departure clearance/routing.\nArrivals:\nA crew member informs ATC that the escape maneuver is complete, and\nThe aircrew has executed an alternate clearance or requested further instructions.\nNOTE-\nWhen the escape procedure is complete, the flight crew must advise ATC they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or request further instructions.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Denver Tower, United 1154, wind shear escape complete, resuming last assigned heading/(name) DP/clearance.”\nOr\n“Denver Tower, United 1154, wind shear escape complete, request further instructions.”\nUSE OF TOWER RADAR DISPLAYS\nUncertified tower display workstations must be used only as an aid to assist controllers in visually locating aircraft or in determining their spatial relationship to known geographical points. Radar services and traffic advisories are not to be provided using uncertified tower display workstations. General information may be given in an easy to understand manner, such as “to your right” or “ahead of you.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“Follow the aircraft ahead of you passing the river at the stacks.” “King Air passing left to right.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-5-3, Functional Use of Certified Tower Radar Displays.\nLocal controllers may use certified tower radar displays for the following purposes:\nTo determine an aircraft's identification, exact location, or spatial relationship to other aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThis authorization does not alter visual separation procedures. When employing visual separation, the provisions of paragraph 7-2-1, Visual Separation, apply unless otherwise authorized by the Service Area Director of Air Traffic Operations.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-2, Primary Radar Identification Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-4, Terminal Automation Systems Identification Methods.\nTo provide aircraft with radar traffic advisories.\nTo provide a direction or suggested headings to VFR aircraft as a method for radar identification or as an advisory aid to navigation.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification), PROCEED (direction)-BOUND, (other instructions or information as necessary),\nor\n(identification), SUGGESTED HEADING (degrees), (other instructions as necessary).\nNOTE-\nIt is important that the pilot be aware of the fact that the directions or headings being provided are suggestions or are advisory in nature. This is to keep the pilot from being inadvertently misled into assuming that radar vectors (and other associated radar services) are being provided when, in fact, they are not.\nTo provide information and instructions to aircraft operating within the surface area for which the tower has responsibility.\nEXAMPLE-\n“TURN BASE LEG NOW.”\nNOTE-\nUnless otherwise authorized, tower radar displays are intended to be an aid to local controllers in meeting their responsibilities to the aircraft operating on the runways or within the surface area. They are not intended to provide radar benefits to pilots except for those accrued through a more efficient and effective local control position. In addition, local controllers at nonapproach control towers must devote the majority of their time to visually scanning the runways and local area; an assurance of continued positive radar identification could place distracting and operationally inefficient requirements upon the local controller. Therefore, since the requirements of paragraph 5-3-1, Application, cannot be assured, the radar functions prescribed above are not considered to be radar services and pilots should not be advised of being in “radar contact.”\nAdditional functions may be performed provided the procedures have been reviewed and authorized by appropriate management levels.\nREFERENCE-",

Caution wake turbulence, Boeing Seven Fifty Seven landing runway three six.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-4-4, Approaches to Multiple Runways.\nLANDING CLEARANCE\nWhen issuing a clearance to land, first state the runway number followed by the landing clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND.\nUSA/USAF/USN NOT APPLICABLE. When issuing a clearance to land and hold short in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.118, Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO), exchange traffic information as necessary. Request a read back of hold short instructions when not received.\nNOTE-\nPilots who prefer to use the full length of the runway or a runway different from that specified are expected to advise ATC prior to landing.\nPilots may not be able to accept a LAHSO clearance when their aircraft is less than 1,000 feet AGL.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY (number)/TAXIWAY (taxiway)/(approach/departure path)/POINT (predetermined point), (traffic, type aircraft, or other information).\nOr\nREAD BACK HOLD SHORT INSTRUCTIONS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway 7 Left, cleared to land, hold short of taxiway Whiskey, traffic crossing downfield.”\nOr (if hold short instructions are not read back with the landing clearance)\n“Read back hold short instructions.”\n“Runway one eight cleared to land, hold short of runway one four left, traffic, (type aircraft) landing runway one four left.”\n“Runway one six cleared to land, hold short of runway seven left, traffic, (type aircraft) departing runway seven left.”\nIf the landing runway is changed, preface the landing clearance with “change to runway” followed by the runway number. Restate the runway number followed by the landing clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCHANGE TO RUNWAY (number), RUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND.\nNOTE-\nThe purpose of the “change to runway” phraseology and restating the runway number is to emphasize to the pilot that they are being cleared to land on a runway other than what they were expecting.\nWhen you become aware that an aircraft is aligned with the wrong surface, inform the pilot and:\nIssue control instructions/clearances, or\nEXAMPLE-\n“United four twenty three, go‐around, you appear to be aligned with the wrong runway.”\n“American sixty three, go‐around, you appear to be aligned with a taxiway.”\n“Southwest two thirty nine, you appear to be aligned with Runway 27 Left (pertinent information), Runway 27 Left, cleared to land.”\nIf time permits, verify the pilot is aligned with the correct runway. Issue control instructions/clearances as necessary.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Twin Cessna four one four lima bravo, verify you are aligned with Runway 27 Left.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-6-4, Safety Logic Alert Responses.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-8, Withholding Landing Clearance.\nProcedures.\nFacilities without a safety logic system or facilities with the safety logic system inoperative or in the limited configuration must not clear an aircraft for a full‐stop, touch‐and‐go, stop‐and‐go, low approach, or option on the same runway with an aircraft holding in position or taxiing to LUAW until the aircraft in position has exited the runway or starts takeoff roll.\nFacilities using safety logic in the full core alert runway configuration may clear an aircraft for a full‐stop, touch‐and‐go, stop‐and‐go, low approach, or option on the same runway with an aircraft holding in position or taxiing to LUAW except when reported weather conditions are less than ceiling 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles.\nInform the closest aircraft that is requesting a full‐stop, touch‐and‐go, stop‐and‐go, low approach, or option when there is traffic authorized to LUAW on the same runway.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Delta One, Runway One-Eight, continue, traffic holding in position.”\n“Delta One, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land. Traffic holding in position.”\n“Twin Cessna Four Four Golf, Runway One-Niner base approved, traffic holding in position.\"\n“Baron Two Five Foxtrot, Runway One-Niner Right extend downwind, tower will call your base, traffic holding in position.\"\nUSA/USN/USAF. Issue runway identifier along with surface wind when clearing an aircraft to land, touch and go, stop and go, low approach, or the option.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number), WIND (surface wind direction and velocity), CLEARED TO LAND.\nNOTE-\nA clearance to land means that appropriate separation on the landing runway will be ensured. A landing clearance does not relieve the pilot from compliance with any previously issued restriction.\nWhenever a runway length has been temporarily or permanently shortened, state the word “shortened” immediately following the runway number as part of the landing clearance. This information must be issued in conjunction with the landing clearance.\nThe addition of “shortened” must be included in the landing clearance for the duration of the construction project when the runway is temporarily shortened.\nThe addition of “shortened” must be included in the landing clearance until the Chart Supplement is updated to include the change(s) when the runway is permanently shortened.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) SHORTENED, CLEARED TO LAND.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two-Seven shortened, cleared to land.”\nIf landing clearance is temporarily withheld, insert the word “shortened” immediately after the runway number to advise the pilot to continue.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) SHORTENED, CONTINUE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two-Seven shortened, continue.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-12, Airport Construction.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-13, Change in Runway Length Due to Construction.\nANTICIPATING SEPARATION\nLanding clearance to succeeding aircraft in a landing sequence need not be withheld if you observe the positions of the aircraft and determine that prescribed runway separation will exist when the aircraft crosses the landing threshold. Issue traffic information to the succeeding aircraft if a preceding arrival has not been previously reported and when traffic will be departing prior to their arrival.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land, number two following a United Seven-Thirty-Seven two mile final. Traffic will depart prior to your arrival.”\n“American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land. Traffic will depart prior to your arrival.”\nNOTE-\nLanding sequence number is optional at tower facilities where the arrival sequence to the runway is established by the approach control.\nAnticipating separation must not be applied when conducting LUAW operations, except as authorized in subparagraph 3-10-5e2. Issue applicable traffic information when using this provision.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Two Forty-Five, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land. Traffic will be a Boeing Seven-Fifty-Seven holding in position.”\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nLANDING CLEARANCE WITHOUT VISUAL OBSERVATION\nWhen an arriving aircraft reports at a position where he/she should be seen but has not been visually observed, advise the aircraft as a part of the landing clearance that it is not in sight and restate the landing runway.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nNOT IN SIGHT, RUNWAY (number) CLEARED TO LAND.\nNOTE-\nAircraft observance on the CTRD satisfies the visually observed requirement.\nWITHHOLDING LANDING CLEARANCE\nDo not withhold a landing clearance indefinitely even though it appears a violation of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations has been committed. The apparent violation might be the result of an emergency situation. In any event, assist the pilot to the extent possible.\nRUNWAY EXITING\nInstruct aircraft where to turn‐off the runway after landing, when appropriate, and advise the aircraft to hold short of a runway or taxiway if required for traffic.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTURN LEFT/RIGHT (taxiway/runway),\nor\nIF ABLE, TURN LEFT/RIGHT (taxiway/runway)\nand if required\nHOLD SHORT OF (runway).\nNOTE-\nRunway exiting or taxi instructions should not normally be issued to an aircraft prior to, or immediately after, touchdown.\nTaxi instructions must be provided to the aircraft by the local controller when:\nCompliance with ATC instructions will be required before the aircraft can change to ground control, or\nThe aircraft will be required to enter an active runway in order to taxi clear of the landing runway.\nEXAMPLE-\n“U.S. Air Ten Forty Two, turn right next taxiway, cross runway two one, contact ground point seven.”\n“U.S. Air Ten Forty Two, turn right on Alfa/next taxiway, cross Bravo, hold short of Charlie, contact ground point seven.”\nNOTE-\nAn aircraft is expected to taxi clear of the runway unless otherwise directed by ATC. Pilots must not exit the landing runway on to an intersecting runway unless authorized by ATC. In the absence of ATC instructions, an aircraft should taxi clear of the landing runway by clearing the hold position marking associated with the landing runway even if that requires the aircraft to protrude into or enter another taxiway/ramp area. This does not authorize an aircraft to cross a subsequent taxiway or ramp after clearing the landing runway.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nThe pilot is responsible for ascertaining when the aircraft is clear of the runway by clearing the runway holding position marking associated with the landing runway.\nGround control and local control must protect a taxiway/runway/ramp intersection if an aircraft is required to enter that intersection to clear the landing runway.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-1-7, Use of Active Runways.\nRequest a read back of runway hold short instructions when not received from the pilot.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Four Ninety-two, turn left at Taxiway Charlie, hold short of Runway 27 Right.”\nor\n“American Four Ninety-two, turn left at Charlie, hold short of Runway 27 Right.”\n“American Four Ninety Two, Roger.”\n“American Four Ninety-two, read back hold instructions.”\nNOTE-\nRead back hold instructions phraseology may be initiated for any point on a movement area when the controller believes the read back is necessary.\nALTITUDE RESTRICTED LOW APPROACH\nA low approach with an altitude restriction of no less than 500 feet above the airport may be authorized except over an aircraft holding in position or a departing aircraft. Do not clear aircraft for restricted altitude low approaches over personnel unless airport authorities have advised these personnel that the approaches will be conducted. Advise the approaching aircraft of the location of applicable ground traffic, personnel, or equipment.\nNOTE-\nThe 500 feet restriction is a minimum. Higher altitudes should be used when warranted. For example, 1,000 feet is more appropriate for super or heavy aircraft operating over unprotected personnel or small aircraft on or near the runway.\nThis authorization includes altitude restricted low approaches over preceding landing or taxiing aircraft. Restricted low approaches are not authorized over aircraft holding in position or departing aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED LOW APPROACH AT OR ABOVE (altitude).

RIGHT TURNS.\nRequest for report on initial approach.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT INITIAL.\n“Break” information and request for pilot report. Specify the point of “break” only if nonstandard. Request the pilot to report “break” if required for traffic or other reasons.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nBREAK AT (specified point).\nREPORT BREAK.\nOverhead maneuver patterns are developed at airports where aircraft have an operational need to conduct the maneuver. An aircraft conducting an overhead maneuver is VFR and the IFR flight plan is canceled when the aircraft reaches the “initial point” on the initial approach portion of the maneuver. The existence of a standard overhead maneuver pattern does not eliminate the possible requirement for an aircraft to conform to conventional rectangular patterns if an overhead maneuver cannot be approved.\nNOTE-\nAircraft operating to an airport without a functioning control tower must initiate cancellation of the IFR flight plan prior to executing the overhead maneuver or after landing.\nFIG 3-10-14Overhead Maneuver\nEXAMPLE-\n“Air Force Three Six Eight, Runway Six, wind zero seven zero at eight, pattern altitude six thousand, report initial.”\n“Air Force Three Six Eight, break at midfield, report break.”\n“Air Force Three Six Eight, cleared to land.”\n“Alfa Kilo Two Two, Runway Three One, wind three three zero at one four, right turns, report initial.”\n“Alfa Kilo Two Two, report break.”\n“Alfa Kilo Two Two, cleared to land.”\nTimely and positive controller action is required to prevent a conflict when an overhead pattern could extend into the path of a departing or a missed approach aircraft. Local procedures and/or coordination requirements should be set forth in an appropriate letter of agreement, facility directive, base flying manual etc., when the frequency of occurrence warrants.\nSIMULATED FLAMEOUT (SFO) APPROACHES/EMERGENCY LANDING PATTERN (ELP) OPERATIONS/PRACTICE PRECAUTIONARY APPROACHES\nAuthorize military aircraft to make SFO/ELP/practice precautionary approaches if the following conditions are met:\nA letter of agreement or local operating procedure is in effect between the military flying organization and affected ATC facility.\nInclude specific coordination, execution, and approval procedures for the operation.\nThe exchange or issuance of traffic information as agreed to in any interfacility letter of agreement is accomplished.\nInclude a statement in the procedure that clarifies at which points SFOs/ELPs may/may not be terminated. (See FIG 3-10-15 and FIG 3-10-17.)\nTraffic information regarding aircraft in radio communication with or visible to tower controllers which are operating within or adjacent to the flameout maneuvering area is provided to the SFO/ELP aircraft and other concerned aircraft.\nThe high‐key altitude or practice precautionary approach maneuvering altitudes of the aircraft concerned are obtained prior to approving the approach. (See FIG 3-10-15 and FIG 3-10-17.)\nNOTE-\nPractice precautionary/SFO/ELP approaches are authorized only for specific aircraft. Any aircraft, however, might make precautionary approaches, when engine failure is considered possible. The practice precautionary approach maneuvering area/altitudes may not conform to the standard SFO/ELP maneuvering area/altitudes.\nSFO/ELP approaches generally require high descent rates. Visibility ahead and beneath the aircraft is greatly restricted.\nPattern adjustments for aircraft conducting SFOs and ELPs may impact the effectiveness of SFO and ELP training.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-8-12, Low Approach and Touch‐and‐Go.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Para 7-1-6, Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations.\nFor overhead SFO/ELP approaches:\nRequest a report at the entry point.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT (high or low) KEY (as appropriate).\nRequest a report at low key.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT LOW KEY.\nAt low key, issue low approach clearance or alternate instructions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-8-1, Sequence/Spacing Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-1-7, Inflight Emergencies Involving Military Fighter‐type Aircraft.\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Para 7-1-6, Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations.\nFor straight-in simulation flameout approaches:\nRequest a position report from aircraft conducting straight-in SFO approaches.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREPORT (distance) MILE SIMULATED FLAMEOUT FINAL.\nAt the appropriate position on final (normally no closer than 3 miles), issue low approach clearance or alternate instruction.

Issue the RCR to other aircraft upon pilot request.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Ice on runway, RCR zero five, patchy.”\nNOTE-\nUSAF offices furnish RCR information at airports serving USAF and ANG aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-3-5, Braking Action Advisories.\nBRAKING ACTION ADVISORIES\nWhen runway braking action reports are received from pilots which include the terms “medium,\" “poor,\" or “nil,\" or whenever weather conditions are conducive to deteriorating or rapidly changing runway conditions, include on the ATIS broadcast the statement “Braking Action Advisories are in effect.\"\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-4-1, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).\nDuring the time Braking Action Advisories are in effect, take the following action:\nIssue the latest braking action report for the runway in use to each arriving and departing aircraft early enough to be of benefit to the pilot. When possible, include reports from super or heavy aircraft when the arriving or departing aircraft is a super or heavy.\nIf no report has been received for the runway of intended use, issue an advisory to that effect.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nNO BRAKING ACTION REPORTS RECEIVED FOR RUNWAY (runway number).\nAdvise the Airport Operator that runway braking action reports of “good to medium,\" “medium,\" “medium to poor,\" “poor,\" or “nil\" have been received.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-1, Letters of Agreement.\nSolicit PIREPs of runway braking action.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para, 2-9-3, Content.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-9-1, Departure Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-1, Landing Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-2, PIREP Solicitation and Dissemination.\nARRESTING SYSTEM OPERATION\nFor normal operations, arresting systems remotely controlled by ATC must remain in the retracted or down position.\nNOTE-\nUSN- Runway Arresting Gear- barriers are not operated by ATC personnel. Readiness/rigging of the equipment is the responsibility of the operations department.\nA request to raise a barrier or hook cable means the barrier or cable on the departure end of the runway. If an approach end engagement is required, the pilot or military authority will specifically request that the approach end cable be raised.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 1, Aircraft Arresting System, Single Frequency Approach (SFA), Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) Operations, Celestial Navigation (CELNAV) Training.\nRaise aircraft arresting systems whenever:\nRequested by a pilot.\nNOTE-\nThe standard emergency phraseology for a pilot requesting an arresting system to be raised for immediate engagement is:\n“BARRIER - BARRIER - BARRIER”\nor\n“CABLE - CABLE - CABLE.”\nRequested by military authority; e.g., airfield manager, supervisor of flying, mobile control officer, etc.\nNOTE-\nUSAF. Arresting Systems at the departure end of the runway may remain in the up position when requested by the senior operational commander. The IFR Enroute Supplement and AP‐1 will describe specific barrier configuration. ATC will advise transient aircraft of the barrier configuration using the phraseology in subparagraph c, below.\nA military jet aircraft is landing with known or suspected radio failure or conditions (drag chute/hydraulic/electrical failure, etc.) that indicate an arresting system may be needed. Exceptions are authorized for military aircraft which cannot engage an arresting system (C-9, C-141, C-5, T-39, etc.) and should be identified in a letter of agreement and/or appropriate military directive.\nWhen requested by military authority due to freezing weather conditions or malfunction of the activating mechanism, the barrier/cable may remain in a raised position provided aircraft are advised.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nYOUR DEPARTURE/LANDING WILL BE TOWARD/OVER A RAISED BARRIER/CABLE ON RUNWAY (number), (location, distance, as appropriate).\nInform civil and U.S. Army aircraft whenever rubber supported cables are in place at the approach end of the landing runway, and include the distance of the cables from the threshold. This information may be omitted if it is published in the Domestic Notices webpage, International Notices webpage, or the DoD FLIP.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway One Four arresting cable one thousand feet from threshold.”\nWhen arresting system operation has been requested, inform the pilot of the indicated barrier/cable position.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Identification), BARRIER/CABLE INDICATES UP/DOWN. CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF/TO LAND.\nTime permitting, advise pilots of the availability of all arresting systems on the runway in question when a pilot requests barrier information.\nIf an aircraft engages a raised barrier/cable, initiate crash alarm procedures immediately.\nFor preplanned practice engagements not associated with emergencies, crash alarm systems need not be activated if, in accordance with local military operating procedures, all required notifications are made before the practice engagement.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.\nFAR FIELD MONITOR (FFM) REMOTE STATUS UNIT\nTo meet the demand for more facilities capable of operating under CAT III weather, Type II equipment is being upgraded to Integrity Level 3. This integrity level will support operations which place a high degree of reliance on ILS guidance for positioning through touchdown.\nInstallation of the FFM remote status indicating units is necessary to attain the integrity necessary to meet internationally agreed upon reliability values in support of CAT III operations on Type II ILS equipment. The remote status indicating unit used in conjunction with Type II equipment adds a third integrity test; thereby, producing an approach aid which has integrity capable of providing Level 3 service.\nThe remote status sensing unit, when installed in the tower cab, will give immediate indications of localizer out‐of‐tolerance conditions. The alarm in the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates an inoperative or an out‐of‐tolerance localizer signal; e.g., the course may have shifted due to equipment malfunction or vehicle/aircraft encroachment into the critical area.\nOperation of the FFM remote sensing unit will be based on the prevailing weather. The FFM remote sensing unit must be operational when the weather is below CAT II ILS minimums.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 6750.24, Appendix A, Abnormal Checklist\nWhen the remote status unit indicates that the localizer FFM is in alarm (aural warning following the preset delay) and:\nThe aircraft is outside the middle marker (MM) or in the absence of a MM, ½ mile final, check for encroachment of those portions of the critical area that can be seen from the tower. It is understood that the entire critical area may not be visible due to low ceilings and poor visibility. The check is strictly to determine possible causal factors for the out-of-tolerance situation. If the alarm has not cleared prior to the aircraft's arriving at the MM or in the absence of a MM, ½ mile final, immediately issue an advisory that the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates the localizer is unreliable.\nThe aircraft is between the MM or ½ mile final and the inner marker (IM), or if the IM is not installed, the CAT II Missed Approach Point (MAP), immediately issue an advisory that the FFM remote status sensing unit indicates the localizer is unreliable.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCAUTION, MONITOR INDICATES RUNWAY (number) LOCALIZER UNRELIABLE.\nThe aircraft has passed the IM or the CAT II MAP (if the IM is not installed) there is no action requirement. Although the FFM has been modified with filters which dampen the effect of false alarms, you may expect alarms when aircraft are located between the FFM and the localizer antenna either on landing or on takeoff.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-7-12, Airport Conditions.",

Airport Surface Detection ProceduresEQUIPMENT USAGE\nThe operational status of ASDE systems must be determined during the relief briefing, or as soon as possible after assuming responsibility for the associated position.\nUse ASDE systems to augment visual observation of aircraft landing or departing, and aircraft or vehicular movements on runways and taxiways, or other parts of the movement area.\nASDE systems with safety logic must be operated continuously.\nASDE systems without safety logic must be operated:\nContinuously between sunset and sunrise.\nWhen visibility is less than the most distant point in the active movement area, or\nWhen, in your judgment, its use will assist you in the performance of your duties at any time.\nNOTE-\nRadar‐only mode is an enhancement of the ASDE-X and ASSC systems that allows the system to stay operational with safety logic processing during a simultaneous loss of the Multilateration (MLAT) subsystem and ADS-B data or loss of ADS-B data when MLAT is not present. The system stays in full core alert status under radar‐only mode but without automatic data block capability.\nIDENTIFICATION\nTo identify an observed target/track on an ASDE system display, correlate its position with one or more of the following:\nPilot/vehicle operator position report.\nController's visual observation.\nAn identified target observed on the ASR or CTRD.\nAn observed target/track on an ASDE system display may be identified as a false target by visual observation. If the area containing a suspected false target is not visible from the tower, an airport operations vehicle or pilots of aircraft operating in the area may be used to conduct the visual observation.\nAfter positive verification that a target is false, through pilot/vehicle operator position report or controller visual observation, the track may be temporarily dropped, which will remove the target from the display and safety logic processing. A notation must be made to FAA Form 7230-4, Daily Record of Facility Operation, when a track is temporarily dropped.\nINFORMATION USAGE\nASDE system derived information may be used to:\nFormulate clearances and control instructions to aircraft and vehicles on the movement area.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-2, ATC Surveillance Source Use.\nPosition aircraft and vehicles using the movement area.\nDetermine the exact location of aircraft and vehicles, or spatial relationship to other aircraft/vehicles on the movement area.\nMonitor compliance with control instructions by aircraft and vehicles on taxiways and runways.\nConfirm pilot reported positions.\nProvide directional taxi information, as appropriate.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTURN (left/right) ON THE TAXIWAY/RUNWAY YOU ARE APPROACHING.\nDo not provide specific navigational guidance (exact headings to be followed) unless an emergency exists or by mutual agreement with the pilot.\nNOTE-\nIt remains the pilot's responsibility to navigate visually via routes to the clearance limit specified by the controller and to avoid other parked or taxiing aircraft, vehicles, or persons in the movement area.\nDo not allow an aircraft to begin departure roll or cross the landing threshold whenever there is an unidentified target/track displayed on the runway.\nSAFETY LOGIC ALERT RESPONSES\nWhen the system generates an alert, the controller must immediately assess the situation visually and as presented on the ASDE system display, then take appropriate action as follows:\nWhen an arrival aircraft (still airborne, prior to the landing threshold) activates a warning alert, the controller must issue go‐around instructions. (Exception: Alerts involving known formation flights, as they cross the landing threshold, may be disregarded if all other factors are acceptable.)\nNOTE-\nThe intent of this paragraph is that an aircraft does not land on the runway, on that approach, when the safety logic system has generated a warning alert.

These are published in the Chart Supplement or the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) and there is no requirement that facility personnel be aware of them. These distances are a means of satisfying airport design criteria and are intended to be used by pilots and/or operators for preflight performance planning only. There are no special markings, signing, or lighting associated with declared distances and they do not limit the actual runway available for use by an aircraft.

A vehicle must have crossed a previous runway before another runway crossing clearance may be issued.\nNOTE-\nA clearance is required for vehicles to operate on any active, inactive, or closed runway except for vehicles operating on closed runways in accordance with a Letter of Agreement (LOA).\nVehicles that have been issued a clearance onto a runway to conduct runway operations are authorized to cross intersecting runways, unless otherwise restricted. Issue hold short instructions as needed.\nNOTE-\nVehicles should not normally use runways as transition routes to other parts of the airfield.  These movements are not considered runway operations and the use of alternative routes is preferred.\nCrossing of active runway(s) by aircraft/vehicle(s):\nDuring departure operations, ensure that aircraft/vehicles intending to cross a runway do not cross the runway holding position markings until the controller visually observes the departure aircraft in a turn, or the departure aircraft has passed the point where the crossing aircraft/vehicle is located, regardless of altitude, unless authorized in FAA Order JO 7110.65, paragraph 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nREFERENCE-\nAIM, Runway Position Holding Markings, Subpara 2-3-5a.\nFAA Order 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nDuring arrival operations, ensure the following:\nAn aircraft/vehicle has completed crossing prior to an arriving aircraft crossing the landing threshold, or\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nAn aircraft/vehicle must not cross the runway holding position markings until an arriving aircraft has completed landing roll and:\nAcknowledged the instruction to exit the runway prior to the point at which the crossing is intended, or\nAcknowledged the instruction to hold short of the point at which the crossing is intended, or\nVisually observed exiting the runway prior to the point at which the crossing is intended, or\nPassed the point at which the crossing is intended.\nLAHSO application: When the arriving aircraft has acknowledged a clearance to land and hold short in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.118, Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO), an aircraft/vehicle may cross the runway beyond the arriving aircraft's hold short point. The crossing aircraft/vehicle must be informed the landing traffic will hold short of the intersection.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(crossing instructions) LANDING TRAFFIC WILL HOLD SHORT OF THE INTERSECTION.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Forty‐Eight, Cross Runway Seven Left at taxiway Whiskey, landing traffic will hold short of the intersection.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-5, Landing Clearance.\nRequest a read back of runway hold short instructions when it is not received from the pilot/vehicle operator.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREAD BACK HOLD INSTRUCTIONS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Four Ninety Two, Runway Three Six Left, taxi via taxiway Charlie, hold short of Runway Two Seven Right.”\nor\n“American Four Ninety Two, Runway Three Six Left, taxi via Charlie, hold short of Runway Two Seven Right.”\n“American Four Ninety Two, Roger.”\n“American Four Ninety Two, read back hold instructions.”\n“Cleveland Tower, American Sixty Three is ready for departure.”\n“American Sixty Three, hold short of Runway Two Three Left, traffic one mile final.”\n“American Sixty Three, Roger.”\n“American Sixty Three, read back hold instructions.”\n“OPS Three proceed via taxiway Charlie hold short of Runway Two Seven.”\nor\n“OPS Three proceed via Charlie hold short of Runway Two Seven.”\n“OPS Three, Roger.”\n“OPS Three, read back hold instructions.”\nNOTE-\nRead back hold instructions phraseology may be initiated for any point on a movement area when the controller believes the read back is necessary.\nIssue progressive taxi/ground movement instructions when:\nA pilot/operator requests.\nThe specialist deems it necessary due to traffic or field conditions, e.g., construction or closed taxiways.\nNecessary during reduced visibility, especially when the taxi route is not visible from the tower.\nNOTE-\nProgressive instructions may include step-by-step directions and/or directional turns.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-4, Runway Proximity.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-11-1, Taxi and Ground Movement Operation.\nIssue instructions to expedite a taxiing aircraft or a moving vehicle.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nTAXI WITHOUT DELAY (traffic if necessary).\nEXIT/PROCEED/CROSS (runway/taxiway) at (runway/taxiway) WITHOUT DELAY.\nIssue instructions to aircraft/vehicle to hold short of an approach/departure hold area when required.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD SHORT OF (runway) APPROACH\nHOLD SHORT OF (runway)DEPARTURE\nGROUND OPERATIONS\nAvoid clearances which require:\nSuper or heavy aircraft to use greater than normal taxiing power.\nSmall aircraft or helicopters to taxi in close proximity to taxiing or hover‐taxi helicopters.\nNOTE-\nUse caution when taxiing smaller aircraft/helicopters in the vicinity of larger aircraft/helicopters. Controllers may use the words rotor wash, jet blast, or prop wash when issuing cautionary advisories.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Follow Boeing 757, Runway Three-Six Left, taxi via Alpha, Caution jet blast.”\nor\nWhen appropriate,\n“Follow CH-53, Runway Two-One, taxi via Bravo, Caution rotor wash.”\nREFERENCE-\nAC 90-23, Aircraft Wake Turbulence, Para 10 and Para 11.\nRUNWAY PROXIMITY\nHold a taxiing aircraft or vehicle clear of the runway as follows:\nInstruct aircraft or vehicle to hold short of a specific runway.\nInstruct aircraft or vehicle to hold at a specified point.\nIssue traffic information as necessary.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD SHORT OF/AT (runway number or specific point), (traffic or other information).\nNOTE-\nEstablishing hold lines/signs is the responsibility of the airport manager. The standards for surface measurements, markings, and signs are contained in AC 150/5300-13, Airport Design; AC 150/5340-1, Standards for Airport Markings, and AC 150/5340-18, Standards for Airport Sign Systems. The operator is responsible for properly positioning the aircraft, vehicle, or equipment at the appropriate hold line/sign or designated point. The requirements in paragraph 3-1-12, Visually Scanning Runways, remain valid as appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-2, Taxi and Ground Movement Operations.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-5, Vehicles/Equipment/Personnel on Runways.\nPRECISION APPROACH CRITICAL AREA\nAircraft and vehicle access to the ILS critical area must be controlled to ensure the integrity of ILS course signals whenever the official weather observation is a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles. Unless the arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight or is circling to land to another runway, do not authorize vehicles/aircraft to operate in or over the critical area, except as specified in subparagraph a1, whenever an arriving aircraft is inside the ILS outer marker (OM) or the fix used in lieu of the OM.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD SHORT OF (runway) ILS CRITICAL AREA.\nNOTE-\nWhen available weather sources such as METARs/SPECI/PIREPs/controller observations indicate weather conditions are changing from VFR to IFR and are deteriorating, actions are expected to be taken to update the official weather observation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-2 PIREP Solicitation and Dissemination.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-3, Reporting Weather Conditions.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-6-5, Disseminating Official Weather Information.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-9-2, Receipt and Dissemination of Weather Observations.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-1, SIGMENT and PIREP Handling.\nFAA Order JO 7900.5, Para 6.4d, Equipment for Sky Condition.\nFAA Order 6750.16, Siting Criteria for Instrument Landing Systems.\nLOCALIZER CRITICAL AREA\nDo not authorize vehicle or aircraft operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside the ILS OM or the fix used in lieu of the OM when the official weather observation is a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles, except:\nA preceding arriving aircraft on the same or another runway that passes over or through the area while landing or exiting the runway.\nA preceding departing aircraft or missed approach on the same or another runway that passes through or over the area.\nIn addition to subparagraph a1(a), when the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of less than 200 feet or RVR 2,000 feet, do not authorize vehicles or aircraft operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside the middle marker, or in the absence of a middle marker, 1/2 mile final.\nGLIDESLOPE CRITICAL AREA. Do not authorize vehicles or aircraft operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside the ILS OM or the fix used in lieu of the OM unless the arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight or is circling to land on another runway when the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles.\nOperators commonly conduct “coupled” or “autoland” approaches to satisfy maintenance, training, or reliability program requirements. Promptly issue an advisory if the critical area will not be protected when an arriving aircraft advises that a “coupled,” “CATIII,” “autoland,” or similar type approach will be conducted and the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of 800 feet or more, or the visibility is 2 miles or more.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nILS CRITICAL AREA NOT PROTECTED.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) is authorized to define criteria for protection of precision approach critical areas at military controlled airports. This protection is provided to all aircraft operating at that military controlled airport. Waiver authority for DoD precision approach critical area criteria rests with the appropriate military authority.\nNOTE-\nSigns and markings are installed by the airport operator to define the ILS critical area. No point along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is permitted past the hold line for holding purposes. The operator is responsible to properly position the aircraft, vehicle, or equipment at the appropriate hold line/sign or designated point. The requirements in paragraph 3-1-12, Visually Scanning Runways, remain valid as appropriate.\nREFERENCE-\nAC150/5340-1, Standards for Airport Markings.\nPRECISION OBSTACLE FREE ZONE (POFZ) AND FINAL APPROACH OBSTACLE CLEARANCE SURFACES (OCS)\nEnsure the POFZ is clear of traffic (aircraft or vehicles) when an aircraft on a vertically-guided final approach is within 2 miles of the runway threshold and the official weather observation indicates the ceiling is below 300 feet or visibility is less than 3/4 SM to protect aircraft executing a missed approach.\nNOTE-\nOnly horizontal surfaces (e.g., the wings) can penetrate the POFZ, but not the vertical surfaces (e.g., fuselage or tail). Three hundred feet (300) is used because ATC does not measure ceilings in fifty (50) foot increments.\nEnsure the final approach OCS (e.g., ILS /LPV W, X, and Y surfaces) are clear of aircraft/vehicles when an aircraft on the vertically-guided approach is within 2 miles of the runway threshold and the official weather observation indicates the ceiling is below 800 feet or visibility is less than 2 SM to protect aircraft executing a missed approach.\nNOTE-\nThe POFZ and the close-in portion of the final approach obstacle clearance surfaces protect aircraft executing a missed approach.\nVehicles that are less than 10 feet in height, necessary for the maintenance of the airport and/or navigation facilities operating outside the movement area, are exempt.\nIf it is not possible to clear the POFZ or OCS prior to an aircraft reaching a point 2 miles from the runway threshold and the weather is less than described in subparagraph a or b above, issue traffic to the landing aircraft.\nNOTE-\nThe POFZ and/or OCS must be cleared as soon as practical.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(ACID), IN THE EVENT OF MISSED APPROACH (issue traffic).\nTAXIING AIRCRAFT/VEHICLE LEFT/RIGHT OF RUNWAY.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United 623, in the event of missed approach, taxiing aircraft right of runway.”\n“Delta 1058, in the event of missed approach, vehicle left of runway.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-6, Traffic Information.\nAC 150/5300-13, Airport Design.\nFIG 3-7-1Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ)",

When issuing additional instructions or information to an aircraft holding in position, include instructions to continue holding or taxi off the runway, unless it is cleared for takeoff.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCONTINUE HOLDING,\nor\nTAXI OFF THE RUNWAY.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-10-10, Altitude Restricted Low Approach.\nWhen authorizing an aircraft to line up and wait at an intersection, state the runway intersection.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) AT (taxiway designator), LINE UP AND WAIT.\nWhen two or more aircraft call the tower ready for departure, one or more at the full length of a runway and one or more at an intersection, state the location of the aircraft at the full length of the runway when authorizing that aircraft to line up and wait.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number), FULL-LENGTH, LINE UP AND WAIT.\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Four Eighty Two, Runway Three-Zero full length, line up and wait.”\nNOTE-\nThe controller need not state the location of the aircraft departing the full length of the runway if there are no aircraft holding for departure at an intersection for that same runway.\nDo not use the term “full length” when the runway length available for departure has been temporarily shortened. On permanently shortened runways, do not use the term “full length” until the Chart Supplement is updated to include the change(s).\nNOTE-\nThe use of the term “full length” could be interpreted by the pilot(s) as the available runway length prior to the runway being shortened.\nWhenever a runway length has been temporarily or permanently shortened, state the word “shortened” immediately following the runway number as part of the line up and wait clearance.\nThe addition of “shortened” must be included in the line up and wait clearance for the duration of the construction project when the runway is temporarily shortened.\nThe addition of “shortened” must be included in the line up and wait clearance until the Chart Supplement is updated to include the change(s) when the runway is permanently shortened.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY (number) SHORTENED, LINE UP AND WAIT.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Runway Two-Seven shortened, line up and wait.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-12, Airport Construction.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-3-13, Change in Runway Length Due to Construction.\nANTICIPATING SEPARATION\nTakeoff clearance need not be withheld until prescribed separation exists if there is a reasonable assurance it will exist when the aircraft starts takeoff roll.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY.\nSAME RUNWAY SEPARATION\nSeparate a departing aircraft from a preceding departing or arriving aircraft using the same runway by ensuring that it does not begin takeoff roll until:\nThe other aircraft has departed and crossed the runway end or turned to avert any conflict. (See FIG 3-9-1.) If you can determine distances by reference to suitable landmarks, the other aircraft needs only be airborne if the following minimum distance exists between aircraft: (See FIG 3-9-2.)\nWhen only Category I aircraft are involved- 3,000 feet.\nWhen a Category I aircraft is preceded by a Category II aircraft- 3,000 feet.\nWhen either the succeeding or both are Category II aircraft- 4,500 feet.\nWhen either is a Category III aircraft- 6,000 feet.",

ClearancesCLEARANCE ITEMS\nIssue the following clearance items, as appropriate, in the order listed below:\nAircraft identification.\nClearance limit.\nWhen the clearance limit is an airport, the word “airport” must follow the airport name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT.\nWhen the clearance limit is a NAVAID, and the NAVAID type is known, the type of NAVAID must follow the NAVAID name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (NAVAID name and type).\nWhen the clearance limit is an intersection or waypoint, and the type is known, the type must follow the intersection or waypoint name.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (intersection or waypoint name and type).\nStandard Instrument Departure (SID) or vectors, where applicable.\nRoute of flight including ADR/ADAR/AAR when applied.\nAltitude data in the order flown.\nMach number, if applicable.\nUSAF. When issuing a clearance to an airborne aircraft containing an altitude assignment, do not include more than one of the following in the same transmission:\nFrequency change.\nTransponder change.\nHeading.\nAltimeter setting.\nTraffic information containing an altitude.\nHolding instructions.\nAny special information.\nFrequency and beacon code information.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-8, IFR-VFR and VFR-IFR Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-5-7, Altitude Information.\nCLEARANCE PREFIX\nPrefix a clearance, information, or a request for information which will be relayed to an aircraft through a non-ATC facility by stating “A-T-C clears,” “A-T-C advises,” or “A-T-C requests.”\nFlight service stations and ARTCC Flight Data Units must prefix a clearance with the appropriate phrase: “ATC clears,” “ATC advises,” etc.\nDELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS\nIssue specific clearance delivery instructions, if appropriate.\nCLEARANCE RELAY\nRelay clearances verbatim.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-4-4, Communications Failure.\nROUTE OR ALTITUDE AMENDMENTS\nAmend route of flight in a previously issued clearance by one of the following:\nState which portion of the route is being amended and then state the amendment.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCHANGE (portion of route) TO READ (new portion of route).\nState the amendment to the route and then state that the rest of the route is unchanged.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Amendment to route), REST OF ROUTE UNCHANGED.\nIssue a clearance “direct” to a point on the previously issued route.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED DIRECT (fix, waypoint).\nOr\nCLEARED DIRECT (destination) AIRPORT.\nNOTE-\nClearances authorizing “direct” to a point on a previously issued route do not require the phrase “rest of route unchanged.” However, it must be understood where the previously cleared route is resumed. When necessary, “rest of route unchanged” may be used to clarify routing.\nIssue the entire route by stating the amendment.\nEXAMPLE-\n(Cessna 21A has been cleared to the Airville Airport via V41 Delta VOR V174 Alfa VOR, direct Airville Airport, maintain 9000. After takeoff, the aircraft is rerouted via V41 Frank intersection, V71 Delta VOR, V174 Alfa VOR. The controller issues one of the following as an amended clearance):\n“Cessna Two One Alfa change Victor Forty-One Delta to read Victor Forty-One Frank, Victor Seventy-One Delta.”\n“Cessna Two One Alfa cleared via Victor Forty-One Frank, Victor Seventy-One Delta, rest of route unchanged.”\n“Cessna Two One Alfa cleared via Victor Forty-One Frank, Victor Seventy-One Delta, Victor One Seventy-Four Alfa V-O-R, direct Airville airport, maintain Niner Thousand.”\nWhen route or altitude in a previously issued clearance is amended, restate all applicable altitude restrictions.\nEXAMPLE-\n(A departing aircraft is cleared to cross Ollis intersection at or above 3,000; Gordonsville VOR at or above 12,000; maintain FL 200. Shortly after departure the altitude to be maintained is changed to FL 240. Because altitude restrictions remain in effect, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Amend altitude. Cross Ollis intersection at or above Three Thousand; cross Gordonsville V-O-R at or above One Two Thousand; maintain Flight Level Two Four Zero.”\n(Shortly after departure, altitude restrictions are no longer applicable, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Climb and maintain Flight Level Two Four Zero.”\n(An aircraft is cleared to climb via a SID with published altitude restrictions. Shortly after departure the top altitude is changed to FL 230 and compliance with the altitude restrictions is still required, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Climb via SID except maintain Flight Level Two Three Zero.”\nNOTE-\nRestating previously issued altitude to “maintain” is an amended clearance. If altitude to “maintain” is changed or restated, whether prior to departure or while airborne and previously issued altitude restrictions are omitted, altitude restrictions are canceled, including SID/STAR altitude restrictions if any.\nCrossing altitudes and speed restrictions on Obstacle Departure Procedure/s (ODP/s) cannot be canceled or amended by ATC.\nIssue an amended clearance if a speed restriction is declined because it cannot be complied with concurrently with a previously issued altitude restriction.\nEXAMPLE-\n(An aircraft is cleared to cross Gordonsville VOR at 11,000. Shortly thereafter he/she is cleared to reduce his/her airspeed to 300 knots. The pilot informs the controller he/she is unable to comply with both clearances simultaneously. The controller issues an amended clearance as follows):\n“Cross Gordonsville VOR at One One Thousand. Then, reduce speed to Three Zero Zero.”\nNOTE-\nThe phrase “do the best you can” or comparable phrases are not valid substitutes for an amended clearance with altitude or speed restrictions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-18, Operational Requests.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Section 6, Vectoring, Para 5-6-2, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Section 7, Speed Adjustment, Para 5-7-2, Methods.\nAir traffic control specialists should avoid route and/or altitude changes for aircraft participating in the North American Route Program (NRP) and that are displaying “NRP” in the remarks section of their flight plan.\nNOTE-\nAir traffic control specialists retain the latitude necessary to tactically resolve conflicts. Every effort should be made to ensure the aircraft is returned to the original filed flight plan/altitude as soon as conditions warrant.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-15, North American Route Program (NRP) Information.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-2, En Route Data Entries.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 18, Section 17, North American Route Program.\nTHROUGH CLEARANCES\nYou may clear an aircraft through intermediate stops.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED THROUGH (airport) TO (fix).\nALTRV CLEARANCE\nUse the phrase “via approved altitude reservation flight plan,” if the aircraft will operate in an approved ALTRV.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nVIA APPROVED ALTITUDE RESERVATION (mission name) FLIGHT PLAN.\nNOTE-\nAn ALTRV normally includes the departure, climb, cruise, and arrival phases of flight up to and including holding pattern or point/time at which ATC provides separation between aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-3, Abbreviated Departure Clearance.\nIFR-VFR AND VFR-IFR FLIGHTS\nClear an aircraft planning IFR operations for the initial part of flight and VFR for the latter part to the fix at which the IFR part ends.\nTreat an aircraft planning VFR for the initial part of flight and IFR for the latter part as a VFR departure. Issue a clearance to this aircraft when it requests IFR clearance approaching the fix where it proposes to start IFR operations. The phraseology CLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT AS FILED may be used with abbreviated departure clearance procedures.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-3, Abbreviated Departure Clearance.\nWhen an aircraft changes from VFR to IFR, the controller must assign a beacon code to Mode‐C equipped aircraft that will allow MSAW alarms.\nWhen VFR aircraft operating below the minimum altitude for IFR operations requests an IFR clearance and the pilot informs you, or you are aware, that they are unable to climb in VFR conditions to the minimum IFR altitude:\nBefore issuing a clearance, ask if the pilot is able to maintain terrain and obstruction clearance during a climb to the minimum IFR altitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Aircraft call sign), ARE YOU ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TERRAIN AND OBSTRUCTION CLEARANCE UNTIL REACHING (appropriate MVA/MIA/MEA/OROCA)\nNOTE-\nPilots of pop-up aircraft are responsible for terrain and obstacle clearance until reaching minimum instrument altitude (MIA) or minimum en route altitude (MEA). Pilot compliance with an approved FAA procedure or an ATC instruction transfers that responsibility to the FAA; therefore, do not assign (or imply) specific course guidance that will (or could) be in effect below the MIA or MEA.\nEXAMPLE-\n“November Eight Seven Six, are you able to provide your own terrain and obstruction clearance between your present altitude and six thousand feet?”\nIf the pilot is able to maintain their own terrain and obstruction clearance, issue the appropriate IFR clearance as prescribed in paragraph 4-2-1, Clearance Items, and paragraph 4-5-6, Minimum En Route Altitudes.\nIf the pilot states that they are unable to maintain terrain and obstruction clearance, instruct the pilot to maintain VFR and to state intentions.\nIf appropriate, apply the provisions of paragraph 10-2-7, VFR Aircraft In Weather Difficulty, or paragraph 10-2-9, Radar Assistance Techniques, as necessary.\nINTERPRETATION-\n7110.65, 4-2-8, IFR-VFR and VFR-IFR Flights (11-03-2014)\nCLEARANCE ITEMS\nThe following guidelines must be utilized to facilitate the processing of airfile aircraft:\nEnsure the aircraft is within your area of jurisdiction unless otherwise coordinated.\nObtain necessary information needed to provide IFR service.\nIssue clearance to destination, short range clearance, or an instruction to the pilot to contact an FSS if the flight plan cannot be processed. If clearance is to destination airport, the phraseology CLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT must be used. If clearance is to a NAVAID, state the name of the NAVAID followed by the type of NAVAID, if the type is known. If clearance is to an intersection or waypoint and the type is known, the type must follow the intersection or waypoint name.\nNOTE-\nThese procedures do not imply that the processing of airfiles has priority over another ATC duty to be performed.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-2-1, Recording Information.\nCANCELLATION OF IFR FLIGHT PLAN\nIf necessary, before instructing an IFR aircraft arriving at an airport not served by an air traffic control tower or flight service station to change to the common traffic advisory frequency, provide the pilot with instructions on how to cancel his/her IFR flight plan.\nAirports with an air/ground communications station:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign) REPORT CANCELLATION OF IFR ON (frequency).\nAirports without an air/ground communications station:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign) REPORT CANCELLATION OF IFR THIS FREQUENCY OR WITH FLIGHT SERVICE.\nOr\n(Call sign) REPORT CANCELLATION OF IFR THIS FREQUENCY OR WITH (FSS serving the area or the ATC controlling facility).\nEXAMPLE-\n“N13WA report cancellation of IFR this frequency or with McAlester Radio.”\nRespond to a pilot's cancellation of his/her IFR flight plan as follows:\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Call sign) IFR CANCELLATION RECEIVED.",

When so advised by the pilot, the controller may be able to plan his/her traffic to accommodate the high performance climb and allow the pilot to climb to his/her planned altitude without restriction.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - CLIMB VIA, TOP ALTITUDE\nTo the maximum extent possible, Air Force One will be cleared unrestricted climb to:\n9,000' AGL or higher.\nIf unable 9,000' AGL or higher, then the highest available altitude below 9,000' AGL.\nAssign the altitude requested by the pilot.\nAssign an altitude, as near as possible to the altitude requested by the pilot, and\nInform the pilot when to expect clearance to the requested altitude unless instructions are contained in the specified SID, or\nIf the requested altitude is not expected to be available, inform the pilot what altitude can be expected and when/where to expect it.\nUse one of the following when the SID contains published crossing restrictions:\nInstruct aircraft to “Climb via SID.”\nInstruct the aircraft to “Climb via SID except maintain (altitude)” when a top altitude is not published or when it is necessary to issue an interim altitude.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Johnston Airport, Scott One departure, Jonez transition, Q One Forty-five.

That section also says that when the failure occurs in IFR conditions the pilot must continue flight at the highest of the following altitudes or flight levels for the route segment being flown:\nThe altitude or flight level assigned in the last ATC clearance received.\nThe minimum altitude (converted, if appropriate, to minimum flight level as prescribed in 14 CFR section 91.121(c)) for IFR operations. (This altitude should be consistent with MEAs, MOCAs, etc.)\nThe altitude or flight level ATC has advised may be expected in a further clearance.\nIf the expected altitude is the highest of the preceding choices, the pilot should begin to climb to that expected altitude at the time or fix specified in the clearance. The choice to climb to the expected altitude is not applicable if the pilot has proceeded beyond the specified fix or if the time designated in the clearance has expired.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB AND MAINTAIN (the altitude as near as possible to the pilot's requested altitude). EXPECT (the requested altitude or an altitude different from the requested altitude) AT (time or fix),\nand if applicable,\n(pilot's requested altitude) IS NOT AVAILABLE.\nEXAMPLE-\nA pilot has requested flight level 350. Flight level 230 is immediately available and flight level 350 will be available at the Appleton zero five zero radial 35 mile fix. The clearance will read:\n“Climb and maintain flight level two three zero. Expect flight level three five zero at Appleton zero five zero radial three five mile fix.”\nA pilot has requested 9,000 feet. An altitude restriction is required because of facility procedures or requirements. Assign the altitude and advise the pilot at what fix/time the pilot may expect the requested altitude. The clearance could read:\n“Climb and maintain five thousand. Expect niner thousand one zero minutes after departure.”\nA pilot has requested 17,000 feet which is unavailable. You plan 15,000 feet to be the pilot's highest altitude prior to descent to the pilot's destination but only 13,000 feet is available until San Jose VOR. Advise the pilot of the expected altitude change and at what fix/time to expect clearance to 15,000 feet. The clearance will read:\n“Climb and maintain one three thousand. Expect one five thousand at San Jose. One seven thousand is not available.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-3-3, Abbreviated Departure Clearance.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-8-2, Initial Heading.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65 Para 4-2-5, Route or Altitude Amendments.\nAIM, Para 4-4-10, Adherence to Clearance.\nABBREVIATED DEPARTURE CLEARANCE\nIssue an abbreviated departure clearance if its use reduces verbiage and the following conditions are met:\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-8, IFR‐VFR and VFR‐IFR Flights.\nThe route of flight filed with ATC has not been changed by the pilot, company, operations officer, input operator, or in the stored flight plan program prior to departure.\nNOTE-\nA pilot will not accept an abbreviated clearance if the route of flight filed with ATC has been changed by him/her or the company or the operations officer before departure. He/she is expected to inform the control facility on initial radio contact if he/she cannot accept the clearance. It is the responsibility of the company or operations officer to inform the pilot when they make a change.\nAll ATC facilities concerned have sufficient route of flight information to exercise their control responsibilities.\nNOTE-\nThe route of flight information to be provided may be covered in letters of agreement.\nWhen the flight will depart IFR, destination airport information is relayed between the facilities concerned prior to departure.\nEXAMPLE-\nA tower or flight service station relay of destination airport information to the center when requesting clearance:\n“Request clearance for United Four Sixty‐One to O'Hare.”\nA center relay to the tower or flight service station when initiating a clearance:\n“Clearance for United Four Sixty‐One to O'Hare.”\nNOTE-\nPilots are expected to furnish the facility concerned with destination airport information on initial radio call‐up. This will provide the information necessary for detecting any destination airport differences on facility relay.\nThe assigned altitude, according to the provisions in paragraph 4-3-2, Departure Clearances, subparagraph e, is stated in the clearance.\nIf it is necessary to modify a filed route of flight in order to achieve computer acceptance due, for example, to incorrect fix or airway identification, the contraction “FRC,” meaning “Full Route Clearance Necessary,” or “FRC/(fix),” will be added to the remarks. “FRC” or “FRC/(fix)” must always be the first item of intra‐center remarks. When “FRC” or “FRC/(fix)” appears on a flight progress strip, the controller issuing the ATC clearance to the aircraft must issue a full route clearance to the specified fix, or, if no fix is specified, for the entire route.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Missoula International Airport, Chief Two Departure to Angley; direct Salina; then as filed; maintain one seven thousand.”\nNOTE-\nChanges, such as those made to conform with traffic flows and preferred routings, are only permitted to be made by the pilot (or his/her operations office) or the controller responsible for initiating the clearance to the aircraft.\nSpecify the destination airport in the clearance.\nWhen no changes are required in the filed route, state the phrase: “Cleared to (destination) airport, ([SID name and number] and SID transition, as appropriate); then, as filed.” If a SID is not assigned, follow with “As filed.” If required, add any additional instructions or information, including requested altitude if different than assigned.\nUse one of the following when the SID contains published crossing restrictions:\nInstruct aircraft to “Climb via SID.”\nInstruct aircraft to “Climb via SID except maintain (altitude)” when a top altitude is not published or when it is necessary to issue an interim altitude.\nNOTE-\nUse of “Climb via SID Except Maintain” to emphasize a published procedural constraint is an inappropriate use of this phraseology.\nInstruct aircraft to MAINTAIN (altitude) when:\nNo SID is assigned.\nA SID does not contain published crossing restrictions and/or is a SID with a Radar Vector segment or is a Radar Vector SID.\nA SID is constructed with a Radar Vector segment and contains published crossing restrictions after the vector segment.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT;\nand as appropriate,\n(SID name and number) DEPARTURE,\nTHEN AS FILED.\nWhen the SID does not contain published crossing restrictions and/or is a SID with a Radar Vector segment or a Radar Vector SID; or is a SID with a radar vector segment and contains published crossing restrictions after the vector segment.\nMAINTAIN (altitude); (additional instructions or\ninformation).\nOr when a SID contains published crossing restrictions,\nCLIMB VIA SID.\nCLIMB VIA SID EXCEPT MAINTAIN (altitude); (additional instructions or information).\nIf a SID is not assigned,\nCLEARED TO (destination) AIRPORT AS FILED.\nMAINTAIN (altitude);\nand if required,\n(additional instructions or information).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Reynolds Airport; David Two Departure, Kingham Transition; then, as filed.

A release time using a specified number of minutes does not require a time check.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(aircraft identification) RELEASED FOR DEPARTURE AT (time in hours and/or minutes),\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF BY (time), ADVISE (facility) NOT LATER THAN (time) OF INTENTIONS.\nTIME (time in hours, minutes, and nearest quarter minute).\n(aircraft identification) RELEASED FOR DEPARTURE IN (number of minutes) MINUTES\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF IN (number of minutes) MINUTES, ADVISE (facility) OF INTENTIONS WITHIN (number of minutes) MINUTES.\nWhen expect departure clearance times (EDCT) are assigned through traffic management programs, excluding overriding call for release (CFR) operations as described in subparagraph e, the departure terminal must, to the extent possible, plan ground movement of aircraft destined to the affected airport(s) so that flights are sequenced to depart no earlier than 5 minutes before, and no later than 5 minutes after the EDCT.  Do not release aircraft on their assigned EDCT if a ground stop (GS) applicable to that aircraft is in effect, unless approval has been received from the originator of the GS.\nIf an aircraft has begun to taxi or requests taxi in a manner consistent with meeting the EDCT, the aircraft must be released. Additional coordination is not required.\nIf an aircraft requests taxi or clearance for departure inconsistent with meeting the EDCT window, ask the pilot to verify the EDCT.\nIf the pilot's EDCT is the same as the FAA EDCT, the aircraft is released consistent with the EDCT.\nIf the pilot's EDCT is not the same as the FAA EDCT, refer to Trust and Verify note below.\nIf an aircraft requests taxi too late to meet the EDCT, contact the ATCSCC through the appropriate TMU.\nNOTE-\n(Trust & Verify) EDCTs are revised by Air Carriers and Traffic Management for changing conditions en route or at affected airport(s). Terminal controllers' use of aircraft reported EDCT for departure sequencing should be verified with the appropriate TMU prior to departure if this can be accomplished without the aircraft incurring delay beyond the EDCT reported by the aircraft. The preferred method for verification is the Flight Schedule Monitor (FSM). If the EDCT cannot be verified without incurring additional delay, the aircraft should be released based on the pilot reported EDCT. The aircraft operator is responsible for operating in a manner consistent to meet the EDCT.\nCall for Release (CFR). When CFR is in effect, release aircraft so they are airborne within a window that extends from 2 minutes prior and ends 1 minute after the assigned time, unless otherwise coordinated.\nNOTE-\nSubparagraph e applies to all facilities.\nCoordination may be verbal, electronic, or written.\nClearance Void Times.\nWhen issuing clearance void times at airports without an operating control tower, provide alternative instructions requiring the pilots to advise ATC of their intentions no later than 30 minutes after the clearance void time if not airborne.\nThe facility delivering a clearance void time to a pilot must issue a time check. A void time issued using a specified number of minutes does not require a time check.\nNOTE-\nIf the clearance void time expires, it does not cancel the departure clearance or IFR flight plan. It withdraws the pilot's authority to depart IFR until a new departure release/release time has been issued by ATC and acknowledged by the pilot.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARANCE VOID IF NOT OFF BY (clearance void time),\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF BY (clearance void time), ADVISE (facility) NOT LATER THAN (time) OF INTENTIONS.\nTIME (time in hours, minutes, and the nearest quarter minute).\nOr\nCLEARANCE VOID IF NOT OFF IN (number of minutes) MINUTES\nand if required,\nIF NOT OFF IN (number of minutes) MINUTES, ADVISE (facility) OF INTENTIONS WITHIN (number of minutes) MINUTES.\nGROUND STOP\nDo not release an aircraft if a ground stop (GS) applicable to that aircraft is in effect, without the approval of the originator of the GS.\nDELAY SEQUENCING\nWhen aircraft elect to take delay on the ground before departure, issue departure clearances to them in the order in which the requests for clearance were originally made if practicable.\nFORWARD DEPARTURE DELAY INFORMATION\nInform approach control facilities and/or towers of anticipated departure delays.\nCOORDINATION WITH RECEIVING FACILITY\nCoordinate with the receiving facility before the departure of an aircraft if the departure point is less than 15 minutes flying time from the transferring facility's boundary unless an automatic transfer of data between automated systems will occur, in which case, the flying time requirement may be reduced to 5 minutes or replaced with a mileage from the boundary parameter when mutually agreeable to both facilities.\nNOTE-\nAgreements requiring additional time are encouraged between facilities that need earlier coordination. However, when agreements establish mandatory radar handoff procedures, coordination needs only be effected in a timely manner prior to transfer of control.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 4, Transfer of Radar Identification, Para 5-4-1, Application.\nThe actual departure time or a subsequent strip posting time must be forwarded to the receiving facility unless assumed departure times are agreed upon and that time is within 3 minutes of the actual departure time.\nVFR RELEASE OF IFR DEPARTURE\nWhen an aircraft which has filed an IFR flight plan requests a VFR departure through a terminal facility, FSS, ARTCC Flight Data Unit, or air/ground communications station:\nAfter obtaining, if necessary, approval from the facility/sector responsible for issuing the IFR clearance, you may authorize an IFR flight planned aircraft to depart VFR. Inform the pilot of the proper frequency and, if appropriate, where or when to contact the facility responsible for issuing the clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nVFR DEPARTURE AUTHORIZED. CONTACT (facility) ON (frequency) AT (location or time if required) FOR CLEARANCE.\nIf the facility/sector responsible for issuing the clearance is unable to issue a clearance, inform the pilot, and suggest that the delay be taken on the ground. If the pilot insists upon taking off VFR and obtaining an IFR clearance in the air, inform the facility/sector holding the flight plan of the pilot's intentions and, if possible, the VFR departure time.\nFORWARDING DEPARTURE TIMES\nTERMINAL\nUnless alternate procedures are prescribed in a letter of agreement or automatic departure messages are being transmitted between automated facilities, forward departure times to the facility from which you received the clearance and also to the terminal departure controller when that position is involved in the departure sequence.\nNOTE-\nLetters of agreement prescribing assumed departure times or mandatory radar handoff procedures are alternatives for providing equivalent procedures.\nThe letters “DM” flashing in the data block signify unsuccessful transmission of a departure message.",

Under those conditions, a cruise clearance without a crossing restriction authorizes a pilot to determine the minimum IFR altitude as prescribed in 14 CFR section 91.177 and descend to it at pilot discretion if it is lower than the altitude specified in the cruise clearance.\nInstructions to climb or descend including restrictions, as required. Specify a time restriction reference the UTC clock reading with a time check. If you are relaying through an authorized communications provider, such as New York Radio, San Francisco Radio, FSS, etc., advise the radio operator to issue the current time to the aircraft when the clearance is relayed. The requirement to issue a time check must be disregarded if the clearance is issued via Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC).\nEXCEPTION. If you are in direct, two-way, VHF/UHF voice communication with the pilot and the aircraft is in radar contact, you may specify an elapsed time interval restriction, in full minute increments only, without any reference to the UTC clock. The time restriction begins once the clearance has been acknowledged by the pilot.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, climb to reach one three thousand at two two one five.”\n“Time two two one one and one-quarter.”\nThe pilot is expected to be level at 13,000 feet at 2215 UTC.\nThrough Relay-“Speedbird Five, climb to reach flight level three-five zero at one-two-one-five, time” (Issue a time check).\nIn radar contact and in direct controller to pilot, two-way, VHF/UHF voice communication - “United Four Seventeen, descend to reach flight level three five zero within two minutes.” The time restriction begins once the clearance has been acknowledged by the pilot.\n“United Four Seventeen climb to leave flight level three three zero within two minutes, maintain flight level three five zero.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 1-2-1, Word Meanings.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-4-17, Numbers Usage.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB/DESCEND AND MAINTAIN (altitude).\nIf required,\nAFTER PASSING (fix, waypoint),\nor\nAT (time) (time in hours, minutes, and nearest quarter minute).\nCLIMB/DESCEND TO REACH (altitude)\nAT (time (issue time check) or fix, waypoint),\nor\nAT (time).

The pilot must comply with the clearance provision to cross the Lakeview VOR at or above FL 200, and after passing Lakeview VOR, the pilot is expected to descend at the rates specified in the AIM until reaching the assigned altitude of 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, cross Lakeview V-O-R at and maintain six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is authorized to conduct descent “at pilot's discretion,” but must comply with the clearance provision to cross Lakeview VOR at 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Four Seventeen, descend now to flight level two seven zero, cross Lakeview V-O-R at or below one zero thousand, descend and maintain six thousand.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is expected to promptly execute and complete descent to FL 270 upon receipt of the clearance. After reaching FL 270, the pilot is authorized to descend “at pilot's discretion” until reaching Lakeview VOR. The pilot must comply with the clearance provision to cross Lakeview VOR at or below 10,000 feet. After Lakeview VOR, the pilot is expected to descend at the rates specified in the AIM until reaching 6,000 feet.\nNOTE-\nA descent clearance which specifies a crossing altitude authorizes descent at pilot's discretion for that portion of the flight to which the crossing altitude restriction applies.\nAny other time that authorization to descend at pilot's discretion is intended, it must be specifically stated by the controller.\nThe pilot may need to know of any future restrictions that might affect the descent, including those that may be issued in another sector, in order to properly plan a descent at pilot's discretion.\nControllers need to be aware that the descent rates in the AIM are only suggested and aircraft will not always descend at those rates.\nREFERENCE-\nP/CG Term - PILOT'S DISCRETION.\nWhen a portion of a climb/descent may be authorized at the pilot's discretion, specify the altitude the aircraft must climb/descend to followed by the altitude to maintain at the pilot's discretion.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLIMB/DESCEND NOW TO (altitude), THEN CLIMB/DESCEND AT PILOT'S DISCRETION MAINTAIN (altitude).\nEXAMPLE-\n“United Three Ten, descend now to flight level two eight zero, then descend at pilot's discretion maintain flight level two four zero.”\nNOTE-\nThe pilot is expected to commence descent upon receipt of the clearance and to descend as prescribed in the AIM, paragraph 4-4-10, Adherence to Clearance, until FL 280. At that point, the pilot is authorized to continue descent to FL 240 within context of the term “at pilot's discretion” as described in the AIM.\nControllers need to be aware that the descent rates are only suggested and aircraft will not always descend at those rates.\nWhen the “pilot's discretion” portion of a climb/descent clearance is being canceled by assigning a new altitude, inform the pilot that the new altitude is an “amended altitude.”\nEXAMPLE-\n“American Eighty Three, amend altitude, descend and maintain Flight Level two six zero.”\nNOTE-\nAmerican Eighty Three, at FL 280, has been cleared to descend at pilot's discretion to FL 240. Subsequently, the altitude assignment is changed to FL 260. Therefore, pilot's discretion is no longer authorized.\nAltitude assignments involving more than one altitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nMAINTAIN BLOCK (altitude) THROUGH (altitude).\nInstructions to vertically navigate SIDs/STARs with published crossing restrictions (Climb Via/Descend Via).\nWhen established on the SID/STAR.\nWhen navigating a published route inbound to the STAR.\nWhen cleared direct to a waypoint/fix without a published altitude, assign a crossing altitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDESCEND VIA (STAR name and number).\nDESCEND VIA (STAR name and number and runway transition number)\nDESCEND VIA (STAR name and number and runway number).\nCLIMB VIA (SID name and number).\nPROCEED DIRECT (fix/waypoint), CROSS (waypoint/fix) at (altitude) THEN DESCEND VIA (STAR name and number)\nEXAMPLE-\n“Descend via the Eagul Five arrival.\"\n“Descend via the Wynde Eight Arrival, Runway 28 right transition.\"\n“Descend via the Lendy One Arrival, Runway 22 left.\"\n“Climb via the Dawgs Four Departure.\"\n“Proceed direct Denis, cross Denis at or above flight level two zero zero, then descend via the Mmell One arrival.\"\nNOTE-\nPilots must comply with all published speed restrictions on SIDs/STARs, independent of a climb via or descend via clearance.\nClearance to “descent via” authorizes pilots:\nTo descend at pilot discretion to meet published restrictions on a STAR. Pilots navigating on a STAR must maintain the last assigned altitude until receiving clearance to descend via. Once leaving an altitude, the pilot may not return to that altitude without an ATC clearance.\nWhen cleared direct to a waypoint, to descend at pilot discretion to meet restrictions on the procedure. ATC assumes obstacle clearance responsibility for aircraft not yet established or taken off of a procedure.\nTo adjust speeds prior to reaching waypoints with published speed restrictions.\nNOTE-\nWhen cleared for SIDs that contain published speed restrictions, the pilot must comply with those speed restrictions independent of any “climb via” clearance.  Clearance to “climb via” authorizes pilots:\nWhen used in the IFR departure clearance, in a PDC, DCL or when subsequently cleared after departure to a waypoint depicted on a SID, to join a procedure after departure or resume a procedure.\nWhen vertical navigation is interrupted and an altitude is assigned to maintain which is not contained on the published procedure, to climb from that previously-assigned altitude at pilot's discretion to the altitude depicted for the next waypoint.

    "content": "IFRHolding Aircraft\nSection 6. Holding AircraftCLEARANCE TO HOLDING FIX\nConsider operational factors such as length of delay, holding airspace limitations, navigational aids, altitude, meteorological conditions when necessary to clear an aircraft to a fix other than the destination airport. Issue the following:\nClearance limit (if any part of the route beyond a clearance limit differs from the last routing cleared, issue the route the pilot can expect beyond the clearance limit).\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE VIA (routing).\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect further clearance via direct Stillwater V-O-R, Victor Two Twenty‐Six Snapy intersection, direct Newark.”\nHolding instructions.\nHolding instructions may be eliminated when you inform the pilot that no delay is expected.\nWhen the assigned procedure or route being flown includes a charted pattern, you may omit all holding instructions except the charted holding direction and the statement “as published.” Always issue complete holding instructions when the pilot requests them.\nNOTE-\nThe most generally used holding patterns are depicted on U.S. Government or commercially produced low/high altitude en route, area, and STAR Charts.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO (fix), HOLD (direction), AS PUBLISHED,\nor\nCLEARED TO (fix), NO DELAY EXPECTED.\nEFC. Do not specify this item if no delay is expected.\nWhen additional holding is expected at any other fix in your facility's area, state the fix and your best estimate of the additional delay. When more than one fix is involved, state the total additional en route delay (omit specific fixes).\nNOTE-\nAdditional delay information is not used to determine pilot action in the event of two‐way communications failure. Pilots are expected to predicate their actions solely on the provisions of 14 CFR section 91.185.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (time),\nand if required,\nANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL (time in minutes/hours) MINUTE/HOUR DELAY AT (fix),\nor\nANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL (time in minutes/hours) MINUTE/HOUR EN ROUTE DELAY.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Expect further clearance one niner two zero, anticipate additional three zero minute delay at Sweet.”\n“Expect further clearance one five one zero, anticipate additional three zero minute en route delay.”\nWhen additional holding is expected in an approach control area, state the total additional terminal delay.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nEXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (time),\nand if required,\nANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL (time in minutes/hours) MINUTE/HOUR TERMINAL DELAY.\nTERMINAL. When terminal delays exist or are expected, inform the appropriate center or approach control facility so that the information can be forwarded to arrival aircraft.\nWhen delay is expected, issue items in subparagraphs a and b at least 5 minutes before the aircraft is estimated to reach the clearance limit. If the traffic situation requires holding an aircraft that is less than 5 minutes from the holding fix, issue these items immediately.\nNOTE-\nThe AIM indicates that pilots should start speed reduction when 3 minutes or less from the holding fix. The additional 2 minutes contained in the 5‐minute requirement are necessary to compensate for different pilot/controller ETAS at the holding fix, minor differences in clock times, and provision for sufficient planning and reaction times.\nWhen holding is necessary, the phrase “delay indefinite” should be used when an accurate estimate of the delay time and the reason for the delay cannot immediately be determined; i.e., disabled aircraft on the runway, terminal or center sector saturation, weather below landing minimums, etc. In any event, every attempt should be made to provide the pilot with the best possible estimate of his/her delay time and the reason for the delay. Controllers/supervisors should consult, as appropriate, with personnel (other sectors, weather forecasters, the airport management, other facilities, etc.) who can best provide this information.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDELAY INDEFINITE, (reason if known), EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (time). (After determining the reason for the delay, advise the pilot as soon as possible.)\nEXAMPLE-\n“Cleared to Drewe, hold west, as published, expect further clearance via direct Sidney V-O-R one three one five, anticipate additional two zero minute delay at Woody.”\n“Cleared to Aston, hold west on Victor two twenty‐five, seven mile leg, left turns, expect further clearance one niner two zero, anticipate additional one five minute terminal delay.”\n“Cleared to Wayne, no delay expected.”\n“Cleared to Wally, hold north, as published, delay indefinite, snow removal in progress, expect further clearance one one three zero.”\nCLEARANCE BEYOND FIX\nIf no delay is expected, issue a clearance beyond the clearance limit as soon as possible and, whenever possible, at least 5 minutes before the aircraft reaches the fix.\nInclude the following items when issuing clearance beyond a clearance limit:\nClearance limit or approach clearance.\nRoute of flight. Specify one of the following:\nComplete details of the route (airway, route, course, fix(es), azimuth course, heading, arc, or vector.)\nThe phrase “via last routing cleared.” Use this phrase only when the most recently issued routing to the new clearance limit is valid and verbiage will be reduced.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nVIA LAST ROUTING CLEARED.\nAssigned altitude if different from present altitude.\nNOTE-\nExcept in the event of a two‐way communications failure, when a clearance beyond a fix has not been received, pilots are expected to hold as depicted on U.S. Government or commercially produced (meeting FAA requirements) low/high altitude en route and area or STAR charts. If no holding pattern is charted and holding instructions have not been issued, pilots should ask ATC for holding instructions prior to reaching the fix. If a pilot is unable to obtain holding instructions prior to reaching the fix, the pilot is expected to hold in a standard pattern on the course on which the aircraft approached the fix and request further clearance as soon as possible.\nDELAYS\nAdvise your supervisor or flow controller as soon as possible when you delay or expect to delay aircraft.\nWhen arrival delays reach or are anticipated to reach 30 minutes, take the following action:\nEN ROUTE. The center responsible for transferring control to an approach control facility or, for a nonapproach control destination, the center in whose area the aircraft will land must issue total delay information as soon as possible after the aircraft enters the center's area. Whenever possible, the delay information must be issued by the first center controller to communicate with the aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-9, ERAM Computer Entry of Hold Information.\nTERMINAL. When tower en route control service is being provided, the approach control facility whose area contains the destination airport must issue total delay information as soon as possible after the aircraft enters its approach control area. Whenever possible, the delay information must be issued by the first terminal controller to communicate with the aircraft.\nUnless a pilot requests delay information, the actions specified in subparagraphs 1 and 2 above may be omitted when total delay information is available to pilots via ATIS.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Airport) ARRIVAL DELAYS (time in minutes/hours).\nHOLDING INSTRUCTIONS\nWhen issuing holding instructions, specify:\nDirection of holding from the fix/waypoint.\nHolding fix or waypoint.\nNOTE-\nThe holding fix may be omitted if included at the beginning of the transmission as the clearance limit.\nRadial, course, bearing, track, azimuth, airway, or route on which the aircraft is to hold.\nLeg length in miles if DME or RNAV is to be used. Specify leg length in minutes if the pilot requests it or you consider it necessary.\nDirection of holding pattern turns only if left turns are to be made, the pilot requests it, or you consider it necessary.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD (direction) OF (fix/waypoint) ON (specified radial, course, bearing, track, airway, azimuth(s), or route.)\nIf leg length is specified,\n(number of minutes/miles) MINUTE/MILE LEG.\nIf direction of turn is specified,\nLEFT/RIGHT TURNS.\nIssue maximum holding airspeed advisories when an aircraft is:\nApproved to exceed the maximum airspeed of a pattern, and is cleared into a holding pattern that will protect for the greater speed; or\nObserved deviating from the holding pattern airspace area; or\nCleared into an airspeed restricted holding pattern in which the icon has not been published.\nEXAMPLE-\nDue to turbulence, a turboprop requests to exceed the recommended maximum holding airspeed. ATCS may clear the aircraft into a pattern that protects for the airspeed request, and must advise the pilot of the maximum holding airspeed for the holding pattern airspace area.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n“MAXIMUM HOLDING AIRSPEED IS TWO ONE ZERO KNOTS.”\nVISUAL HOLDING POINTS\nYou may use as a holding fix a location which the pilot can determine by visual reference to the surface if he/she is familiar with it.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nHOLD AT (location) UNTIL (time or other condition.)\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-1-4, Visual Holding of VFR Aircraft.\nHOLDING FLIGHT PATH DEVIATION\nApprove a pilot's request to deviate from the prescribed holding flight path if obstacles and traffic conditions permit.\nUNMONITORED NAVAIDs\nSeparate an aircraft holding at an unmonitored NAVAID from any other aircraft occupying the course which the holding aircraft will follow if it does not receive signals from the NAVAID.\nILS PROTECTION/CRITICAL AREAS\nWhen the official weather observation indicates a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility of 2 miles, do not authorize aircraft to hold below 5,000 feet AGL inbound toward the airport on or within 1 statute mile of the localizer between the ILS OM or the fix used in lieu of the OM and the airport.

If, by following the route of flight to the holding fix, the aircraft would overfly an IAF or the fix associated\\ with the beginning of a feeder route to be used, the aircraft is expected to commence the approach using the published feeder route to the IAF or from the IAF as appropriate; that is, the aircraft would not be expected to overfly and return to the IAF or feeder route.\nApproach name items contained within parenthesis; for example, RNAV (GPS) Rwy 04, are not included in approach clearance phraseology.\nPilots are required to advise ATC when intending to apply cold temperature compensation to instrument approach segments. Pilots must advise ATC of the amount of compensation required for each affected segment on initial contact or as soon as possible. Pilots are not required to advise ATC when correcting on the final segment only. Controllers may delay the issuance of an approach clearance to comply with approved separation requirements when informed that a pilot will apply cold temperature compensation (CTC). Pilots will not apply altitude compensation, unless authorized, when assigned an altitude prior to an approach clearance. Consideration should be given to vectoring aircraft at or above the requested compensating altitude if possible. This eliminates pilots having to climb once on the approach.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS).\nP/CG Term - COLD TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION.\nAIM, Para 5-1-17, Cold Temperature Operations.\nAIM, Para 5-5-4, Instrument Approach.",

Before the aircraft begins its final descent, issue the appropriate departure instructions the pilot is to follow upon completion of the approach (in accordance with paragraph 4-3-2, Departure Clearances). Climb‐out instructions must include a specific heading or a route of flight and altitude, except when the aircraft will maintain VFR and contact the tower.\nEXAMPLE-\n“After completing low approach, climb and maintain six thousand. Turn right, heading three six zero.”\n“Maintain VFR, contact tower.”\n(Issue other instructions as appropriate.)\nNOTE-\nClimb‐out instructions may be omitted after the first approach if instructions remain the same.",

Coordination is not required when immediate action is dictated.\nSuppressing/Inhibiting CA/MCI alert.\nThe controller may suppress the display of a CA/MCI alert from a control position with the application of one of the following suppress/inhibit computer functions:\nThe Conflict Suppress (CO) function may be used to suppress the CA/MCI display between specific aircraft for a specific alert.\nNOTE-\nSee NAS-MD-678 for the EARTS conflict suppress message.\nThe Group Suppression (SG) function must be applied exclusively to inhibit the displaying of alerts among military aircraft engaged in special military operations where standard en route separation criteria does not apply.\nNOTE-\nSpecial military operations where the SG function would typically apply involve those activities where military aircraft routinely operate in proximities to each other that are less than standard en route separation criteria; i.e., air refueling operations, ADC practice intercept operations, etc.\nThe computer entry of a message suppressing a CA/MCI alert constitutes acknowledgment for the alert and signifies that appropriate action has or will be taken.\nThe CA/MCI alert may not be suppressed or inhibited at or for another control position without being coordinated.\nEN ROUTE MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE WARNING (E‐MSAW)\nWhen an E‐MSAW alert is displayed, immediately analyze the situation and take the appropriate action to resolve the alert.\nNOTE-\nCaution should be exercised when issuing a clearance to an aircraft in reaction to an E‐MSAW alert to ensure that adjacent MIA areas are not a factor.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nThe controller may suppress the display of an E‐MSAW alert from his/her control position with the application of one of the following suppress/inhibit computer functions:\nThe specific alert suppression message may be used to inhibit the E‐MSAW alerting display on a single flight for a specific alert.\nThe indefinite alert suppression message must be used exclusively to inhibit the display of E‐MSAW alerts on aircraft known to be flying at an altitude that will activate the alert feature of one or more MIA areas within an ARTCC.\nNOTE-\nThe indefinite alert suppression message will remain in effect for the duration of the referenced flight's active status within the ARTCC unless modified by controller action.\nThe indefinite alert suppression message would typically apply to military flights with clearance to fly low‐level type routes that routinely require altitudes below established minimum IFR altitudes.\nThe computer entry of a message suppressing or inhibiting E‐MSAW alerts constitutes acknowledgment for the alert and indicates that appropriate action has or will be taken to resolve the situation.\nCOMPUTER ENTRY OF FLIGHT PLAN INFORMATION\nAltitude\nThe altitude field(s) of the data block must always reflect the current status of the aircraft unless otherwise specified in an appropriate facility directive.\nUnless otherwise specified in a facility directive or letter of agreement, do not modify assigned or interim altitude information prior to establishing communication with an aircraft that is outside your area of  jurisdiction unless verbal coordination identifying who will modify the data block has been accomplished.\nNOTE-\nA local interim altitude (LIA) can be used as a means of recording interfacility coordination.\nConflict probe in EDST does not probe for the LIA.\nWhenever an aircraft is cleared to maintain an altitude different from that in the flight plan database, enter into the computer one of the following:\nThe new assigned altitude if the aircraft will (climb or descend to and) maintain the new altitude, or\nAn interim altitude if the aircraft will (climb or descend to and) maintain the new altitude for a short period of time and subsequently be recleared to the altitude in the flight plan database or a new altitude or a new interim altitude, or\nERAM\nA procedure altitude if the aircraft is cleared to vertically navigate (VNAV) on a SID/STAR with published restrictions, or\nWhere appropriate for interfacility handoffs, an LIA when the assigned altitude differs from the coordinated altitude unless verbally coordinated or specified in a letter of agreement or facility directive.\nNOTE-\nA facility directive may be published, in accordance with JO 7210.3, paragraph 8-2-7, Waiver to Interim Altitude Requirements, deleting the interim altitude computer entry requirements of subparagraph 3.\nFlight Plan Route Data\nThis information must not be modified outside of the controller's area of jurisdiction unless verbally coordinated or specified in a Letter of Agreement or Facility Directive.\nENTRY OF REPORTED ALTITUDE\nWhenever Mode C altitude information is either not available or is unreliable, enter reported altitudes into the computer as follows:\nNOTE-\nAltitude updates are required to assure maximum accuracy in applying slant range correction formulas.\nWhen an aircraft reaches the assigned altitude.\nWhen an aircraft at an assigned altitude is issued a clearance to climb or descend.\nA minimum of each 10,000 feet during climb to or descent from FL 180 and above.\nSELECTED ALTITUDE LIMITS\nThe display of Mode C targets and limited data blocks is necessary for application of Merging Target Procedures. Sectors must ensure the display of Mode C targets and data blocks by entering appropriate altitude limits and display filters to include, as a minimum, the altitude stratum of the sector plus:\n1,200 feet above the highest and below the lowest altitude or flight level of the sector where 1,000 feet vertical separation is applicable; and\n2,200 feet above the highest and below the lowest flight level of the sector where 2,000 feet vertical separation is applicable.\nNOTE-\nThe data block, for purposes of this paragraph, must contain the Mode C altitude and call sign or beacon code at a minimum.\nException to these requirements may be authorized for specific altitudes in certain ARTCC sectors if defined in appropriate facility directives and approved by the respective service area operations directorate.\nSECTOR ELIGIBILITY\nThe use of the OK function is allowed to override sector eligibility only when one of the following conditions is met:\nPrior coordination is effected.\nThe flight is within the control jurisdiction of the sector.\nCOAST TRACKS\nDo not use coast tracks in the application of either radar or nonradar separation criteria.\nCONTROLLER INITIATED COAST TRACKS\nInitiate coast tracks only in Flight Plan Aided Tracking (FLAT) mode, except “free” coast tracking may be used as a reminder that aircraft without corresponding computer‐stored flight plan information are under your control.\nNOTE-\nTo ensure tracks are started in FLAT mode, perform a start track function at the aircraft's most current reported position, then immediately “force” the track into coast tracking by performing another start function with “CT” option in field 64. Making amendments to the stored route with trackball entry when the aircraft is rerouted, and repositioning the data block to coincide with the aircraft's position reports are methods of maintaining a coast track in FLAT mode.\nPrior to initiating a coast track, ensure that a departure message or progress report corresponding with the aircraft's current position is entered into the computer.\nAs soon as practicable after the aircraft is in radar surveillance, initiate action to cause radar tracking to begin on the aircraft.\nERAM COMPUTER ENTRY OF HOLD INFORMATION\nWhen an aircraft is issued holding instructions, the delay is ATC initiated, and the EFC is other than “no delay expected:\"\nEnter a hold message.\nMaintain a paired track.\nEnter an EFC time via a hold message, the Hold Data Menu, or the Hold View.\nEnter non-published holding instructions via a hold message or the Hold Data Menu.\nNOTE-\nThe ERAM hold message allows automatic calculation and reporting of aggregate delays.\nUnless otherwise specified in a facility directive, verbally coordinate non-published holding instructions when handing off an aircraft in hold status to another ERAM sector.\nAn EFC time entered into the Hold Data Menu, Hold View, or the hold message constitutes coordination of the EFC between ERAM sectors.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 8-2-9, ERAM Hold Information Facility Directive Requirements.\nERAM VISUAL INDICATOR OF SPECIAL ACTIVITY AIRSPACE (SAA) STATUS\nSector controllers must ensure the situation display's Airspace Status View/SAA Filter View accurately reflects the status of adapted Special Activity Airspace (SAA) that impact their area of control responsibility. When “SAA DOWN” is displayed in the Outage View, manually create visual indicators on the situation display to reflect changes to airspace status.\nNOTE-\nThe “SAA DOWN” message in the Outage View means that SAA status is no longer being updated.

Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS)-TerminalAPPLICATION\nSTARS may be used for identifying aircraft assigned a discrete beacon code, maintaining identity of targets, and performing handoffs of these targets between controllers. All procedures for the terminal domain related to air traffic control services using STARS apply to the FUSION target.\nRESPONSIBILITY\nThis equipment does not relieve the controller of the responsibility to ensure proper identification, maintenance of identity, handoff of the correct target associated with the alphanumeric data, and separation of aircraft.\nFUNCTIONAL USE\nIn addition to other uses specified herein, terminal automation may be used for the following functions:\nTracking.\nTagging.\nHandoff.\nAltitude information.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-2-21, Altitude Filters.\nCoordination.\nGround speed.\nIdentification.\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\nUse terminal automation systems as follows:\nNOTE-\nLocally developed procedures, operating instructions, and training material are required because of differences in equipment capability. Such locally developed procedures must be supplemental to those contained in this section and must be designed to make maximum use of the STARS equipment.\nInform all appropriate positions before terminating or reinstating use of the terminal automation system at a control position. When terminating the use of terminal automation systems, all pertinent flight data of that position must be transferred or terminated.\nInform other interfaced facilities of scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns.\nInitiate a track/tag on all aircraft to the maximum extent possible. As a minimum, aircraft identification should be entered, and automated handoff functions should be used.\nAssigned altitude, if displayed, must be kept current at all times. Climb and descent arrows, where available, must be used to indicate other than level flight.\nWhen operating in FUSION mode, the assigned or pilot reported altitude must be displayed and kept current when the aircraft is in level flight.\nThe automatic altitude readout of an aircraft under another controller's jurisdiction may be used for vertical separation purposes without verbal coordination provided:\nOperation is conducted using single-site radar coverage or when operating in FUSION mode.\nPrearranged coordination procedures are contained in a facility directive in accordance with paragraph 5-4-9, Prearranged Coordination, and FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 3-6-7, Prearranged Coordination.\nDo not use Mode C to effect vertical separation within a Mosaic radar configuration.\nINFORMATION DISPLAYED\nTwo‐letter ICAO designators or three‐letter designators, as appropriate, must be used unless program limitations dictate the use of a single letter alpha prefix.\nUse of the inhibit/select functions to remove displayed information no longer required must be in accordance with local directives, which should ensure maximum required use of the equipment.\nInformation displayed must be in accordance with national orders and specified in local directives.\nDuring outages of the ASR that supports an ASDE system where MLAT is inoperative or is not present, the tower position(s) responsible for aircraft on approach to the airport must enable the ADS-B indicator on the tower display workstation(s) (TDW(s)).\nNOTE-\nThe ADS-B indicator will only display if the TDW is operating in Fused Display Mode.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nCA/MCI\nWhen a CA or MCI alert is displayed, evaluate the reason for the alert without delay and take appropriate action.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nIf another controller is involved in the alert, initiate coordination to ensure an effective course of action. Coordination is not required when immediate action is dictated.\nSuppressing/Inhibiting CA/MCI alert.\nThe suppress function may be used to suppress the display of a specific CA/MCI alert.\nThe inhibit function must only be used to inhibit the display of CA for aircraft routinely engaged in operations where approved separation criteria do not apply.\nNOTE-\nExamples of operations where approved separation criteria do not apply are ADC practice intercept operations and air shows.\nComputer entry of a message suppressing a CA/MCI alert constitutes acknowledgment for the alert and signifies that appropriate action has or will be taken.\nCA/MCI alert may not be suppressed or inhibited at or for another control position without being coordinated.\nINHIBITING MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE WARNING (MSAW)\nInhibit MSAW processing of VFR aircraft and aircraft that cancel instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plans unless the pilot specifically requests otherwise.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-7, VFR Aircraft in Weather Difficulty.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-8, Radar Assistance to VFR Aircraft in Weather Difficulty.\nA low altitude alert may be suppressed from the control position. Computer entry of the suppress message constitutes an acknowledgment for the alert and indicates that appropriate action has or will be taken.\nTRACK SUSPEND FUNCTION\nUse the track suspend function only when data block overlap in holding patterns or in proximity of the final approach create an unworkable situation. If necessary to suspend tracks, those which are not displaying automatic altitude readouts must be suspended. If the condition still exists, those displaying automatic altitude readouts may then be suspended.",

Beacon/ADS-B SystemsASSIGNMENT CRITERIA\nGeneral.\nMode 3/A is designated as the common military/civil mode for air traffic control use.\nMake beacon code assignments to only ADS-B and/or transponder-equipped aircraft.\nNOTE-\nAircraft equipped with ADS-B are also still required to have an operable transponder. The ATC-assigned beacon code is one of the required message elements of ADS-B Out.\nUnless otherwise specified in this section, a facility directive, or a letter of agreement, issue beacon codes assigned by the computer. Computer-assigned codes may be modified as required.\nNOTE-\nThe computer will assign only discrete beacon codes unless all the discrete codes allocated to a facility are in use.\nTERMINAL. Aircraft that will remain within the terminal facility's delegated airspace must be assigned a code from the code subset allocated to the terminal facility.\nTERMINAL. Unless otherwise specified in a facility directive or a letter of agreement, aircraft that will enter an adjacent facility's delegated airspace must be assigned a beacon code assigned by the ARTCC computer.\nNOTE-\nThis will provide the adjacent facility advance information on the aircraft and will cause auto-acquisition of the aircraft prior to handoff. When an airborne aircraft that has been assigned a beacon code by the ARTCC computer and whose flight plan will terminate in another facility's area cancels ATC service, appropriate action should be taken to remove flight plan information on that aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK THREE/ALFA (code),\nor\nSQUAWK (code).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-4, Terminal Automation Systems Identification Methods.\nCode 4000 should be assigned when aircraft are operating on a flight plan specifying frequent or rapid changes in assigned altitude in more than one stratum or other category of flight not compatible with a discrete code assignment.\nNOTE-\nCategories of flight that can be assigned Code 4000 include certain flight test aircraft, MTR missions, aerial refueling operation requiring descent involving more than one stratum, ALTRVs where continuous monitoring of ATC frequencies is not required and frequent altitude changes are approved, and other flights requiring special handling by ATC.\nMilitary aircraft operating in restricted/warning areas or on VR routes will squawk 4000 unless another code has been assigned or coordinated with ATC.\nRADAR BEACON CODE CHANGES\nUnless otherwise specified in a directive or a letter of agreement or coordinated at the time of handoff, do not request an aircraft to change from the code it was squawking in the transferring facility's area until the aircraft is within your area of responsibility.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-8, IFR‐VFR and VFR‐IFR Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nEMERGENCY CODE ASSIGNMENT\nAssign codes to emergency aircraft as follows:\nCode 7700 when the pilot declares an emergency and the aircraft is not radar identified.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK MAYDAY ON 7700.\nNOTE-\nInstead of displaying “7700\" in the data block, ERAM will display “EMRG,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “EM.”\nAfter radio and radar contact have been established, you may request other than single-piloted helicopters and single-piloted turbojet aircraft to change from Code 7700 to a computer-assigned discrete code.\nNOTE-\nThe code change, based on pilot concurrence, the nature of the emergency, and current flight conditions, will signify to other ATC facilities that the aircraft in distress is identified and under ATC control.\nPilots of single-piloted helicopters and single-piloted turbojet aircraft may be unable to change transponder settings during an emergency.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR CONTACT (position). IF FEASIBLE, SQUAWK (code).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nThe following must be accomplished on a Mode C equipped VFR aircraft which is in emergency but no longer requires the assignment of Code 7700:\nTERMINAL. Assign a beacon code that will permit terminal minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) alarm processing.\nEN ROUTE. An appropriate keyboard entry must be made to ensure en route MSAW (EMSAW) alarm processing.\nRADIO FAILURE\nWhen you observe a Code 7600 display, apply the procedures in paragraph 10-4-4, Communications Failure.\nNOTE-\nAn aircraft experiencing a loss of two-way radio communications capability can be expected to squawk Code 7600.\nInstead of displaying “7600” in the data block, ERAM will display “RDOF,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “RF.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nHIJACK/UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE\nWhen you observe a Code 7500 display, apply the procedures in paragraph 10-2-6, Hijacked Aircraft.\nNOTE-\nInstead of displaying “7500” in the data block, ERAM will display “HIJK,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “HJ.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nUNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) LOST LINK\nCode 7400 may be transmitted by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) when the control link between the aircraft and the pilot is lost. Lost link procedures are programmed into the flight management system and associated with the flight plan being flown.\nWhen you observe a Code 7400 display, do the following:\nNOTE-\nInstead of displaying “7400” in the data block, ERAM will display “LLNK,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “LL.”\nDetermine the lost link procedure, as outlined in the Special Airworthiness Certificate or Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA).\nCoordinate, as required, to allow UAS to execute the lost link procedure.\nAdvise the OS/CIC, when feasible, so the event can be documented.\nIf you observe or are informed by the PIC that the UAS is deviating from the programmed Lost Link procedure, or is encountering another anomaly, treat the situation in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.65 Chapter 10, Section 1, paragraph 10-1-1c.\nNOTE-\nThe available lost link procedure should, at a minimum, include lost link route of flight, lost link orbit points, lost link altitudes, communications procedures and preplanned flight termination points if the event recovery of the UAS is deemed unfeasible.\nEach lost link procedure may differ and is dependent upon airframe and operation. These items are contained in the flight's Certificate of Authorization or Waiver (COA) and must be made available to ATC personnel in their simplest form at positions responsible for Unmanned Aircraft (UAs).\nSome UA airframes (Global Hawk) will not be programmed upon the NAS Automation roll out to squawk 7400. These airframes will continue to squawk 7600 should a lost link occur. The ATC Specialist must apply the same procedures described above.\nVFR CODE ASSIGNMENTS\nFor VFR aircraft receiving radar advisories, issue a computer-assigned beacon code.\nIf the aircraft is outside of your area of responsibility and an operational benefit will be gained by retaining the aircraft on your frequency for the purpose of providing services, ensure that coordination has been effected:\nAs soon as possible after positive identification, and\nPrior to issuing a control instruction or providing a service other than a safety alert/traffic advisory.\nNOTE-\nSafety alerts/traffic advisories may be issued to an aircraft prior to coordination if an imminent situation may be averted by such action. Coordination should be effected as soon as possible thereafter.\nInstruct an IFR aircraft that cancels its IFR flight plan and is not requesting radar advisory service, or a VFR aircraft for which radar advisory service is being terminated, to squawk VFR.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK VFR.\nor\nSQUAWK 1200.\nNOTE-\nAircraft not in contact with ATC may squawk 1255 in lieu of 1200 while en route to/from or within designated firefighting areas.\nVFR aircraft that fly authorized SAR missions for the USAF or USCG may be advised to squawk 1277 in lieu of 1200 while en route to/from or within the designated search area.\nVFR gliders should squawk 1202 in lieu of 1200. Gliders operate under some flight and maneuvering limitations. They may go from essentially stationary targets while climbing and thermaling to moving targets very quickly. They can be expected to make radical changes in flight direction to find lift and cannot hold altitude in a response to an ATC request. Gliders may congregate together for short periods of time to climb together in thermals and may cruise together in loose formations while traveling between thermals.\nThe lead aircraft in a standard VFR formation flight not in contact with ATC should squawk 1203 in lieu of 1200. All other aircraft in the formation should squawk standby.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.66, National Beacon Code Allocation Plan.\nWhen an aircraft changes from VFR to IFR, assign a beacon code to Mode C equipped aircraft that will allow MSAW alarms.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nBEACON CODES FOR PRESSURE SUIT FLIGHTS AND FLIGHTS ABOVE FL 600\nSpecial use Mode 3/A codes are reserved for certain pressure suit flights and aircraft operations above FL 600 in accordance with FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations, Appendix 4, Document 2.\nEnsure that these flights remain on one of the special use codes if filed in the flight plan, except:\nWhen unforeseen events cause more than one aircraft to be in the same or adjacent ARTCC's airspace at the same time on the same special use discrete code, if necessary, you may request the pilot to make a code change, squawk standby, or stop squawk as appropriate.\nNOTE-\nCurrent FAA automation systems track multiple targets on the same beacon code with much greater reliability than their predecessors, and a code change may not be necessary for such flights.\nThe beacon code is often preset on the ground for such flights and is used throughout the flight profile, including operations below FL 600. Due to equipment inaccessibility, the flight crew may not be able to accept transponder changes identified in this subparagraph.\nIn case of emergency, Code 7700 can still be activated. Instead of displaying “7700” in the data block, ERAM will display “EMRG,” and STARS/MEARTS will display “EM.”\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nAIR DEFENSE EXERCISE BEACON CODE ASSIGNMENT\nEN ROUTE\nEnsure exercise FAKER aircraft remain on the exercise flight plan filed discrete beacon code.\nNOTE-\nNORAD will ensure exercise FAKER aircraft flight plans are filed containing discrete beacon codes from the Department of Defense code allocation specified in FAA Order JO 7610.4, Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations, Appendix 6.\nNORAD will ensure that those FAKER aircraft assigned the same discrete beacon code are not flight planned in the same or any adjacent ARTCC's airspace at the same time.

Such transponders must have a Mode 3/A 4096 code capability, replying to Mode 3/A interrogation with the code specified by ATC, or a Mode S capability, replying to Mode 3/A interrogations with the code specified by ATC. The aircraft must also be equipped with automatic pressure altitude reporting equipment having a Mode C capability that automatically replies to Mode C interrogations by transmitting pressure altitude information in 100‐foot increments.\nThe exception to 14 CFR section 91.215 (b) is 14 CFR section 91.215(b)(5) which states: except balloons, gliders, and aircraft without engine‐driven electrical systems.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 20, Temporary Flight Restrictions.\nExcept in an emergency, do not approve inflight requests for authorization to deviate from 14 CFR section 91.215(b)(5)(i) requirements originated by aircraft without transponder equipment installed.\nApprove or disapprove other inflight deviation requests, or withdraw approval previously issued to such flights, solely on the basis of traffic conditions and other operational factors.\nAdhere to the following sequence of action when an inflight VFR deviation request is received from an aircraft with an inoperative transponder or Mode C, or is not Mode C equipped:\nSuggest that the aircraft conduct its flight in airspace unaffected by the CFRs.\nSuggest that the aircraft file an IFR flight plan.\nSuggest that the aircraft provide a VFR route of flight and maintain radio contact with ATC.\nDo not approve an inflight deviation unless the aircraft has filed an IFR flight plan or a VFR route of flight is provided and radio contact with ATC is maintained.\nYou may approve an inflight deviation request which includes airspace outside your jurisdiction without the prior approval of the adjacent ATC sector/facility providing a transponder/Mode C status report is forwarded prior to control transfer.\nApprove or disapprove inflight deviation requests within a reasonable period of time or advise when approval/disapproval can be expected.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nBEACON TERMINATION\nInform the pilot when you want their aircraft's transponder and ADS-B Out turned off.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSTOP SQUAWK.\n(For a military aircraft when you do not know if the military service requires that it continue operating on another mode),\nSTOP SQUAWK (mode in use).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nALTITUDE FILTERS\nTERMINAL\nSet altitude filters to display Mode C altitude readouts to encompass all altitudes within the controller's jurisdiction. Set the upper limits no lower than 1,000 feet above the highest altitude for which the controller is responsible. In those stratified positions, set the lower limit to 1,000 feet or more below the lowest altitude for which the controller is responsible. When the position's area of responsibility includes down to an airport field elevation, the facility will normally set the lower altitude filter limit to encompass the field elevation so that provisions of paragraph 2-1-6, Safety Alert, and paragraph 5-2-15, Validation of Mode C Altitude Readout, subparagraph b2 may be applied.

Radar IdentificationAPPLICATION\nBefore you provide radar service, establish and maintain radar identification of the aircraft involved, except as provided in paragraph 5-5-1, Application, subparagraphs b2, b3 and in paragraph 8-5-5, Radar Identification Application.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-1-1, Presentation and Equipment Performance.\nPRIMARY RADAR IDENTIFICATION METHODS\nIdentify a primary, radar beacon, or ADS-B target by using one of the following methods:\nObserving a departing aircraft target within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end at airports with an operating control tower, provided one of the following methods of coordination is accomplished.\nA verbal rolling/boundary notification is issued for each departure, or\nA nonverbal rolling/boundary notification is used for each departure aircraft.\nNOTE-\nNonverbal notification can be accomplished via the use of a manual or electronic “drop tube” or automation.\nObserving a target whose position with respect to a fix (displayed on the video map, scribed on the map overlay, or displayed as a permanent echo) or a visual reporting point (whose range and azimuth from the radar antenna has been accurately determined and made available to the controller) corresponds with a direct position report received from an aircraft, and the observed track is consistent with the reported heading or route of flight. If a TACAN/VORTAC is located within 6,000 feet of the radar antenna, the TACAN/VORTAC may be used as a reference fix for radar identification without being displayed on the video map or map overlay.\nNOTE-\nEstablishment of radar identification through use of DME position information can be complicated by the fact that some military TACANs are not collocated with frequency-paired VORs and might be separated from them by as much as 31 miles.\nVisual reporting points used for RADAR identification are limited to those most used by pilots and whose range and azimuth have been determined by supervisory personnel.\nObserving a target make an identifying turn or turns of 30 degrees or more, provided the following conditions are met:\nNOTE-\nUse of identifying turns or headings which would cause the aircraft to follow normal IFR routes or known VFR flight paths might result in misidentification. When these circumstances cannot be avoided, additional methods of identification may be necessary.\nExcept in the case of a lost aircraft, a pilot position report is received which assures you that the aircraft is within radar coverage and within the area being displayed.\nOnly one aircraft is observed making these turns.\nFor aircraft operating in accordance with an IFR clearance, you either issue a heading away from an area which will require an increased minimum IFR altitude or have the aircraft climb to the highest minimum altitude in your area of jurisdiction before you issue a heading.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-12-11, Surveillance Unusable.\nBEACON/ADS-B IDENTIFICATION METHODS\nWhen using only Mode 3/A radar beacon or ADS-B to identify a target, use one of the following methods:\nRequest the pilot to activate the “IDENT” feature of the transponder/ADS-B and then observe the identification display.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nIDENT.\nSQUAWK (code) AND IDENT.\nRequest the pilot to change to a specific discrete or nondiscrete code, as appropriate, and then observe the target or code display change. If a code change is required in accordance with Section 2, Beacon/ADS-B Systems, of this chapter, use the codes specified therein.\nRequest the pilot to change their transponder/ADS-B to “standby.” After you observe the target disappear for sufficient scans to assure that loss of target resulted from placing the transponder/ADS-B in “standby” position, request the pilot to return the transponder to normal operation and then observe the reappearance of the target.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK STANDBY,\nthen\nSQUAWK NORMAL.\nEN ROUTE. An aircraft may be considered identified when the full data block is automatically associated with the target symbol of an aircraft that is squawking a discrete code assigned by the computer.\nNOTE-\nPaired LDBs in ERAM do not display a beacon code.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSQUAWK (4 digit discrete code),\nor, if aircraft's altitude reporting capability is turned off,\nSQUAWK (4 digit discrete code), SQUAWK ALTITUDE.\nNOTE-\nThe AIM informs pilots to adjust Mode C transponders and ADS-B with altitude reporting capability activated unless deactivation is requested by ATC. “Squawk altitude” is included here to provide applicable phraseology.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-3-6, Position Information.\nTERMINAL AUTOMATION SYSTEMS IDENTIFICATION METHODS\nTERMINAL\nConsider an auto‐acquired aircraft as identified when the data block is displayed and is visible to you, and one of the following conditions exist:\nThe radar or beacon identification procedures have been used to confirm the identity of the tagged target.\nThe aircraft is being handed off using a NAS automated system and one of the following does not appear in the data block: “CST”, “NAT”, “NT”, “AMB”, “OLD”, “AM”, or “TRK”.\nUse the data block to maintain target identity unless it is in a coast status or displaced from the appropriate target.\nA displaced data block must be updated at all times.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays.\nQUESTIONABLE IDENTIFICATION\nUse more than one method of identification when proximity of targets, duplication of observed action, or any other circumstances cause doubt as to target identification.\nIf identification is questionable for any reason, take immediate action to re-identify the aircraft or terminate radar service. Identify the aircraft as follows:\nAs described in paragraph 5-3-2, Primary Radar Identification Methods, or paragraph 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods.\nEn route.  Ensure that all primary targets are displayed when radar identification is lost or is questionable.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nPOSITION INFORMATION\nInform an aircraft of its position whenever radar identification is established by means of identifying turns or by any of the beacon identification methods outlined in paragraph 5-3-3, Beacon/ADS-B Identification Methods. Position information need not be given when identification is established by position correlation or when a departing aircraft is identified within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end.\nIDENTIFICATION STATUS\nInform an aircraft of radar contact when:\nInitial radar identification in the ATC system is established.\nSubsequent to loss of radar contact or terminating radar service, radar identification is reestablished.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR CONTACT (position if required).\nInform an aircraft when radar contact is lost.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR CONTACT LOST (alternative instructions when required).\nDATA BLOCKS\nEN ROUTE\nRetain data blocks that are associated with the appropriate target symbol in order to maintain continuous identity of aircraft. Retain the data block until the aircraft has exited the sector or delegated airspace, and all potential conflicts have been resolved; including an aircraft that is a point out. The data block must display flight identification and altitude information, as a minimum. The displayed altitude may be assigned, interim, or reported.\nERAM: When you have separation responsibility for an aircraft and a paired track exists, display a full data block (FDB).\nDATA BLOCKS\nTERMINAL\nRetain data blocks that are associated with the appropriate target symbol in order to maintain continuous identity of aircraft. Retain the data block until the aircraft has exited the sector or delegated airspace, and all potential conflicts have been resolved; including an aircraft that is a point out. The data block must display flight identification and altitude information, as a minimum.\nNOTE-\nWhere delegated airspace extends beyond Class B and/or Class C airspace, the following will apply: If a VFR aircraft is clear of Class B and Class C airspace and radar services have been terminated then retention of the data block is no longer required.\nDuring prearranged coordination procedures, the controllers who penetrate another controller's airspace must display data block information of that controller's aircraft which must contain, at a minimum, the position symbol and altitude information.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-9, Prearranged Coordination.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-6, Prearranged Coordination.",

    "content": "FAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-9-5, Approach Separation Responsibility.\nConsider a beacon target's identity to be confirmed when:\nThe data block associated with the target being handed off indicates the computer assigned discrete beacon code is being received; or\nYou observe the deletion of a discrete code that was displayed in the data block; or\nNOTE-\nWhen the beacon code received from the aircraft does not match the computer assigned beacon code, the code received (ERAM, MEARTS) or the site-adapted code (received, computer-assigned, or both for STARS) will be displayed in the data block. When the aircraft changes to the computer assigned code, the code is automatically removed from the data block. In this instance, the observance of code removal from the data block satisfies confirmation requirements.\nYou observe the numeric display of a discrete code that an aircraft has been instructed to squawk or reports squawking.\nTake the identified action prior to accepting control of a track when the following indicators are displayed in the data block:\n“AMB” or “AM”: advise the other facility that a disparity exists between the position declared by their computer and the position declared by your STARS/MEARTS system.\n“NAT” or “NT”: advise the other facility if a disparity exists between the position declared by their computer and the actual target position.\n“DATA,” “CST,” “NONE,” or “OLD”: initiate verbal coordination.\nERAM: Notify the OS/CIC when a MISM is displayed in the data block.\nAdvise the transferring controller as soon as possible if you will delay the climb or descent of the aircraft through the vertical limits of that controller's area of jurisdiction, unless otherwise specified in an LOA or a facility directive.\nPOINT OUT\nThe transferring controller must:\nObtain approval before permitting an aircraft to enter the receiving controller's delegated airspace.\nEN ROUTE: Automated approval may be utilized in lieu of verbal approval. If the receiving controller takes no action, revert to verbal procedures.\nNOTE-\nUse fourth line data for aircraft not on their flight plan route.\nWhere specified in a letter of agreement, some facilities may restrict interfacility automated point outs.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-10-1, En Route Or Oceanic Sector Team Responsibilities.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-10, En Route Fourth Line Data Block Usage.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-13-3, Computer Entry of Flight Plan Information.\nTERMINAL: Automated point out approval may be utilized in lieu of verbal provided the procedures are contained in a facility directive/LOA.\nObtain the receiving controller's approval before making any changes to an aircraft's flight path, altitude, speed, or data block information after the point out has been approved.\nComply with restrictions issued by the receiving controller unless otherwise coordinated.\nBe responsible for subsequent radar handoffs and communications transfer, including flight data revisions and coordination, unless otherwise agreed to by the receiving controller or as specified in a LOA.\nThe receiving controller must:\nEnsure that the target position corresponds with the position given by the transferring controller or that there is an association between a computer data block and the target being transferred prior to approving a point out.\nBe responsible for separation between point out aircraft and other aircraft for which he/she has separation responsibility.\nIssue restrictions necessary to provide separation from other aircraft within his/her area of jurisdiction.\nAUTOMATED INFORMATION TRANSFER (AIT)\nTransfer radar identification, altitude control, and/or en route fourth line control information, without verbal coordination under the following conditions:\nDuring radar handoff; and\nVia information displayed in full data blocks; and\nWhen following procedures specified in your facility AIT directive and/or LOA.\nNOTE-\nInformation transferred using AIT procedures may be bi-directional, and may involve more than two sectors. Complete coordination, awareness of traffic flow, and understanding of each position's responsibilities concerning AIT procedures cannot be overemphasized.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-10, En Route Fourth Line Data Block Usage.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-10, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nPREARRANGED COORDINATION\nPrearranged coordination allowing aircraft under your control to enter another controller's area of jurisdiction may only be approved provided procedures are established and published in a facility directive in accordance with FAA Order JO 7210.3, paragraph 3-6-6, Prearranged Coordination.\nNOTE-\nUnder no circumstances may one controller permit an aircraft to enter another's airspace without proper coordination. Coordination can be accomplished by several means; i.e., radar handoff, automated information transfer, verbal, point-out, and by prearranged coordination procedures identified in a facility directive that clearly describe the correct application. Airspace boundaries should not be permitted to become barriers to the efficient movement of traffic. In addition, complete coordination, awareness of traffic flow, and understanding of each position's responsibility concerning penetration of another's airspace cannot be overemphasized.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-14, Coordinate Use of Airspace.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-3, Methods.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 3-6-6, Prearranged Coordination.\nEN ROUTE FOURTH LINE DATA BLOCK USAGE\nThe fourth line of the data block must be displayed. When using the fourth line for forwarding control information, only messages specified in this section, a facility directive or LOA are authorized. Any additional control information must be forwarded via other communications methods. Free text may be used by individual sector teams for recording information the team deems appropriate for managing the sector, but must be removed prior to initiation of identification transfer.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-5, Transferring Controller Handoff, Subpara b.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nThe en route fourth line data block area must be used for coordination purposes only in association with radar identified aircraft.\nWhen automated information transfer (AIT) procedures are applied, en route fourth line usage for transfer of control information must be specifically defined within facility AIT directive.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-4-8, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 4-3-10, Automated Information Transfer (AIT).\nCoordination format for assigned headings must use the designation character “H” preceding a three-digit number.\nEXAMPLE-\nH080, H270\nAircraft assigned a heading until receiving a fix or joining a published route must be designated with assigned heading format followed by the fix or route.\nNOTE-\nThe notation “PH” may be used to denote present heading.\nThe character “H” may be omitted as a prefix to the heading assignment only if necessary due to character field limitations, and it does not impede understanding.\nEXAMPLE-\nH080/ALB, 080/J121, PH/ALB\nCoordination format for weather deviations must use the designated characters:\nD-deviation\nL-left\nR-right\nN-north\nE-east\nS-south\nW-west\n/F-direct next NAVAID/waypoint in the flight plan\nD(heading)-(heading)-deviate between two specified headings.\nNOTE-\nTwo digits specify turns in degrees and must include direction character(s). Three digits specify heading(s).\nThe inclusion of /(NAVAID) or /(waypoint), when preceded by the designated characters for weather deviations, indicates that a pilot has been authorized to deviate for weather and rejoin the route at the specified NAVAID or waypoint. The use of /F, following the designated weather deviation characters, indicates that a pilot has been authorized to deviate and rejoin the route of flight at the next fix in the route in accordance with paragraph 2-6-4.\nEXAMPLE-\nD90L/ATL, DL/KD75U, D090/F\nThe absence of /NAVAID, /waypoint, or /F after the weather deviation designated characters indicates that the pilot has been authorized to deviate for weather, and the receiving controller must provide a clearance to rejoin the route of flight in accordance with subparagraph 2-1-15c.\nEXAMPLE-\nDN, D20L, D30R, D180-210\nCoordination format for specific assigned airspeeds must use the designation character “S” preceding a three‐digit number. A three-digit number followed by a “+” must be used to denote an assigned speed at or greater than the displayed value, or followed by a “-” to denote an assigned speed at or less than the displayed value.\nEXAMPLE-\nS210, 250+, 280-\nAircraft assigned a Mach number must use the designation “M”, “M.”, or “.” preceding the two‐digit assigned value. The displayed Mach number must also be followed by a “+” to denote an assigned speed at or greater than the displayed value, or a “-” to denote an assigned speed at or less than the displayed value.\nEXAMPLE-\nM80, M80+, M80-, M.80, .80, .80-\nCoordination format for aircraft authorized to conduct celestial navigation training within 30 NM of the route centerline specified within the en route clearance must use “CELNAV.”\nCoordination format for aircraft requesting an altitude change must use the designation characters “RQ” preceding a three‐digit number.\nEXAMPLE-\nRQ170, RQ410\nCoordination format for aircraft requesting a route change must use the designation “RQ/” preceding a specific fix identifier.\nEXAMPLE-\nRQ/LAX, RQ/NEUTO\nThe acceptance of a handoff by the receiving controller must constitute receipt of the information contained within the en route fourth line data block.This information must not be modified outside of the controller's area of jurisdiction unless verbally coordinated or specified in a Letter of Agreement or Facility Directive. It is the responsibility of the receiving controller to advise the transferring controller if any information is not understood, or needs to be revised.\nNOTE-\nDue to system and character limitations the usage of these standardized entries may require additional support via facility directive in order to provide complete coordination.\nAll other control information must be coordinated via other methods.",

Current equipment limitations preclude a target from being displayed in the single sensor mode; however, a position symbol and data block, including altitude information, will still be displayed. Therefore, low altitude alerts must be provided in accordance with paragraph 2-1-6, Safety Alert.\nTERMINAL. FUSION:\nFusion target symbol - 3 miles.\nWhen displaying ISR in the data block- 5 miles.\nNOTE-\nIn the event of an unexpected ISR on one or more aircraft, the ATCS working that aircraft must transition from 3‐mile to 5‐mile separation, or establish some other form of approved separation as soon as feasible. This action must be timely, but taken in a reasonable fashion, using the controller's best judgment, as not to reduce safety or the integrity of the traffic situation. For example, if ISR appears when an aircraft is established on final with another aircraft on short final, it would be beneficial from a safety perspective to allow the trailing aircraft to continue the approach and land rather than terminate a stabilized approach.",

    "content": "RadarSpeed Adjustment\nSection 7. Speed AdjustmentAPPLICATION\nKeep speed adjustments to the minimum necessary to achieve or maintain required or desired spacing.  Avoid adjustments requiring alternate decreases and increases. Terminate speed adjustments when no longer needed.\nNOTE-\nIt is the pilot's responsibility and prerogative to refuse speed adjustment that he/she considers excessive or contrary to the aircraft's operating specifications.\nConsider the following when applying speed control:\nDetermine the interval required and the point at which the interval is to be accomplished.\nImplement speed adjustment based on the following principles.\nPriority of speed adjustment instructions is determined by the relative speed and position of the aircraft involved and the spacing requirement.\nSpeed adjustments are not achieved instantaneously. Aircraft configuration, altitudes, and speed determine the time and distance required to accomplish the adjustment.\nUse the following techniques in speed control situations:\nCompensate for compression when assigning air speed adjustment in an in‐trail situation by using one of the following techniques:\nReduce the trailing aircraft first.\nIncrease the leading aircraft first.\nAssign a specific airspeed if required to maintain spacing.\nAllow increased time and distance to achieve speed adjustments in the following situations:\nHigher altitudes.\nGreater speed.\nClean configurations.\nEnsure that aircraft are allowed to operate in a clean configuration as long as circumstances permit.\nKeep the number of speed adjustments per aircraft to the minimum required to achieve and maintain spacing.\nDo not assign speed adjustment to aircraft:\nAt or above FL 390 without pilot consent.\nExecuting a published high altitude instrument approach procedure.\nIn a holding pattern.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-6-4, Holding Instructions.\nInside the final approach fix on final or a point 5 miles from the runway, whichever is closer to the runway.\nAt the time approach clearance or a climb via/descend via clearance is issued, previously assigned speeds must be restated if required.\nApproach clearances or climb via/descend via clearances cancel any previously assigned speeds. Pilots are expected to make their own speed adjustments to fly the approach, SID, or STAR unless assigned speeds are restated.\nNOTE-\nPilots are required to comply with published speed restrictions.\nA speed restriction published as part of a SID/STAR is canceled when an aircraft is vectored off, or a deviation from the SID/STAR is approved. If necessary, assign a speed in conjunction with the vector or approval to deviate.\nNOTE-\nThe last published speed on a STAR will be maintained by the aircraft until ATC deletes it, assigns a new speed, issues a vector, assigns a direct route or issues an approach clearance.\nWhen issuing speed adjustments to aircraft cleared along a route or procedure that has published speed restrictions, if feasible, advise the pilot where you intend on allowing the aircraft to resume the published speed.\nNOTE-\nIf it is anticipated that an aircraft will be allowed to resume the published speeds on a procedure, advising the pilot where that may occur avoids flight crews from unnecessarily deleting speeds from the Flight Management System.\nExpress speed adjustments in terms of knots based on indicated airspeed (IAS) in 5‐knot increments. At or above FL 240, speeds may be expressed in terms of Mach numbers in 0.01 increments for aircraft with Mach meters (Mach 0.69, 0.70, 0.71, etc.).\nNOTE-\nPilots complying with speed adjustment instructions (published or assigned) should maintain a speed within plus or minus 10 knots or 0.02 Mach number of the specified speed.\nWhen assigning speeds to achieve spacing between aircraft at different altitudes, consider that ground speed may vary with altitude. Further speed adjustment may be necessary to attain the desired spacing.\nControllers should anticipate pilots will begin adjusting speed at the minimum distance necessary prior to a published speed restriction so as to cross the waypoint/fix at the published speed. Once at the published speed, controllers should expect pilots will maintain the published speed until additional adjustment is required to comply with further published restrictions or ATC assigned speed restrictions.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-7-2, Methods.\nMETHODS\nInstruct aircraft to:\nMaintain present/specific speed.\nMaintain specified speed or greater/less.\nMaintain the highest/lowest practical speed.\nIncrease or reduce to a specified speed in single‐digit form or by a specified number of knots in group form.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSAY AIRSPEED.\nSAY MACH NUMBER.\nMAINTAIN PRESENT SPEED.\nMAINTAIN (specific speed) KNOTS.\nMAINTAIN (specific speed) KNOTS OR GREATER.\nDO NOT EXCEED (speed) KNOTS.\nMAINTAIN MAXIMUM FORWARD SPEED.\nMAINTAIN SLOWEST PRACTICAL SPEED.\nINCREASE/REDUCE SPEED:\nTO (specified speed in knots),\nor\nTO MACH (Mach number),\nor\n(number of knots) KNOTS.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Increase speed to Mach point seven two.”\n“Reduce speed to two five zero.”\n“Reduce speed twenty knots.”\n“Maintain two eight zero knots.”\n“Maintain maximum forward speed.”\nNOTE-\nA pilot operating at or above 10,000 feet MSL on an assigned speed adjustment greater than 250 knots is expected to comply with 14 CFR section 91.117(a) when cleared below 10,000 feet MSL, within domestic airspace, without notifying ATC. Pilots are expected to comply with the other provisions of 14 CFR section 91.117 without notification.\nSpeed restrictions of 250 knots do not apply to aircraft operating beyond 12 NM from the coastline within the U.S. Flight Information Region, in offshore Class E airspace below 10,000 feet MSL. However, in airspace underlying a Class B airspace area designated for an airport, or in a VFR corridor designated through such a Class B airspace area, pilots are expected to comply with the 200 knot speed limit specified in 14 CFR section 91.117(c). (See 14 CFR sections 91.117(c) and 91.703.)\nThe phrases “maintain maximum forward speed” and “maintain slowest practical speed” are primarily intended for use when sequencing a group of aircraft. As the sequencing plan develops, it may be necessary to determine the specific speed and/or make specific speed assignments.\nTo obtain pilot concurrence for a speed adjustment at or above FL 390, as required by paragraph 5-7-1, Application, use the following phraseology.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Speed adjustment), IF UNABLE ADVISE.\nEXAMPLE-\n“Reduce speed to one niner zero, if unable advise.”\nSimultaneous speed reduction and descent can be extremely difficult, particularly for turbojet aircraft. Specifying which action is to be accomplished first removes any doubt the pilot may have as to controller intent or priority. Specify which action is expected first when combining speed reduction with a descent clearance.\nSpeed reductions prior to descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nREDUCE SPEED:\nTO (specified speed),\nor\n(number of knots) KNOTS.\nTHEN, DESCEND AND MAINTAIN (altitude).\nSpeed reduction following descent.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nDESCEND AND MAINTAIN (altitude).\nTHEN, REDUCE SPEED:\nTO (specified speed in knots),\nor\nTO MACH (Mach number),\nor\n(number of knots) KNOTS.\nNOTE-\nWhen specifying descent prior to speed reduction, consider the maximum speed requirements specified in 14 CFR section 91.117.

Pilots are expected to comply with the other provisions of 14 CFR section 91.117 without notification.\nSpeed restrictions of 250 knots do not apply to aircraft operating beyond 12 NM from the coastline within the U.S. Flight Information Region, in offshore Class E airspace below 10,000 feet MSL. However, in airspace underlying a Class B airspace area designated for an airport, or in a VFR corridor designated through such a Class B airspace area, pilots are expected to comply with the 200 knot speed limit specified in 14 CFR section 91.117(c). (See 14 CFR sections 91.117(c) and 91.70).\nThe phrases “maintain maximum forward speed\" and “maintain slowest practical speed\" are primarily intended for use when sequencing a group of aircraft. As the sequencing plan develops, it may be necessary to determine the specific speed and/or make specific speed assignments.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-7-2, Methods.\n14 CFR Sections 91.117(c) and 91.703.\nTERMINATION\nAdvise aircraft when speed adjustments are no longer needed.\nAdvise aircraft to “resume normal speed” when ATC-assigned speed adjustments are no longer required and no published speed restrictions apply.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRESUME NORMAL SPEED.\nNOTE-\n“Resume normal speed” is only used where there is no underlying published speed restriction.

Visual approaches may be conducted simultaneously with visual or instrument approaches to other runways, provided:\nApproved separation is maintained until the aircraft conducting the visual approach has been issued, and the pilot has acknowledged receipt of, the visual approach clearance.\nWhen aircraft flight paths intersect, approved separation must be maintained until visual separation is provided.\nNOTE-\nAlthough simultaneous approaches may be conducted to intersecting runways, staggered approaches may be necessary to meet the airport separation requirements specified in paragraph 3-10-4, Intersecting Runway/Intersecting Flight Path Separation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-7-3, Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-8-3, Separation.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-9-4, Separation.\nCHARTED VISUAL FLIGHT PROCEDURES (CVFP). USA/USN NOT APPLICABLE\nClear an aircraft for a CVFP only when the following conditions are met:\nThere is an operating control tower.\nThe published name of the CVFP and the landing runway are specified in the approach clearance, the reported ceiling at the airport of intended landing is at least 500 feet above the MVA/MIA, and the visibility is 3 miles or more, unless higher minimums are published for the particular CVFP.\nWhen using parallel or intersecting/converging runways, the criteria specified in paragraph 7-4-4, Approaches to Multiple Runways, are applied.\nAn aircraft not following another aircraft on the approach reports sighting a charted visual landmark, or reports sighting a preceding aircraft landing on the same runway and has been instructed to follow that aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Ident) CLEARED (name of CVFP) APPROACH.\nRNAV VISUAL FLIGHT PROCEDURES (RVFP)\nRNAV Visual Flight Procedures (RVFPs) are special procedures flown in VMC and clear of clouds and used by authorized operators only. Clear an aircraft for an RVFP when:\nRequested by the pilot, or if necessary, as addressed in a Letter of Agreement (LOA).\nThe pilot reports the airport in sight or, at locations with an operating control tower, the preceding aircraft in sight.\nAn altitude is assigned at or above the MVA/MIA, before issuing an approach clearance when conducting an RVFP. The pilot should join the RVFP at the beginning of the charted procedure, or if necessary, may join at another waypoint along the path of the charted procedure, except for waypoints beginning or within an RF leg.\nThe official weather at the airport of intended landing indicates VFR and should meet or exceed the ceiling and visibility specified on the RVFP.\nThe published name of the RVFP and the landing runway are specified in the approach clearance.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\n(Ident) CLEARED RNAV VISUAL RUNWAY (number) APPROACH\nNOTE-\nRefer to the facility RVFP LOAs, if applicable, to determine the authorized operators.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8260.60, Special Procedures.\nCONTACT APPROACH\nClear an aircraft for a contact approach only if the following conditions are met:\nThe pilot has requested it.\nNOTE-\nWhen executing a contact approach, the pilot is responsible for maintaining the required flight visibility, cloud clearance, and terrain/obstruction clearance. Unless otherwise restricted, the pilot may find it necessary to descend, climb, and/or fly a circuitous route to the airport to maintain cloud clearance and/or terrain/obstruction clearance. It is not in any way intended that controllers will initiate or suggest a contact approach to a pilot.\nThe reported ground visibility is at least 1 statute mile.",

Basic Radar Service to VFR Aircraft- TerminalAPPLICATION\nBasic radar services for VFR aircraft must include:\nSafety alerts.\nTraffic advisories.\nLimited radar vectoring when requested by the pilot.\nSequencing at locations where procedures have been established for this purpose and/or when covered by a LOA.\nApply the procedures contained in paragraph 7-1-3, Approach Control Service for VFR Arriving Aircraft, when arriving VFR aircraft are handled by approach control and provide vectoring service in accordance with Chapter 5, Radar, Section 7, Speed Adjustment, in addition to the radar services prescribed in paragraph 5-6-1, Application, and paragraph 5-6-2, Methods.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-16, Surface Areas.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-6-1, Application.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Chapter 12, Section 1, Terminal VFR Radar Services.\nAIM, Para 4-1-18, Terminal Radar Services for VFR Aircraft.\nSERVICE AVAILABILITY\nInform aircraft on initial contact whenever this service cannot be provided because of radar outage and apply paragraph 7-1-3, Approach Control Service for VFR Arriving Aircraft.\nProvide the service, to the extent possible using an available frequency, if an aircraft desires the service but cannot communicate on the appropriate frequencies. Aircraft which do not desire radar service may be fitted into the landing sequence by the tower. Coordination of these aircraft must be accomplished with the approach control unless a facility directive/LOA prescribes otherwise. Nonparticipating aircraft must, to the extent possible, be given the same landing sequence they would have received had they been sequenced by radar vectors.\nRadar sequencing to the primary airport, when local procedures have been developed, must be provided unless the pilot states that the service is not requested. Arriving aircraft are assumed to want radar service unless the pilot states “Negative radar service,” or makes a similar comment.\nINITIAL CONTACT\nAn aircraft sighted by the local controller at the time of first radio contact may be positioned in the landing sequence after coordination with approach control.\nIDENTIFICATION\nIdentify the aircraft before taking action to position it in the approach sequence.\nHOLDING\nHold VFR aircraft over the initial reporting fix or a fix near the airport when holding is required to establish an approach sequence.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 7-1-4, Visual Holding of VFR Aircraft.\nAPPROACH SEQUENCE\nDo not assign landing sequence numbers, when establishing aircraft in the approach sequence, unless this responsibility has been delegated in a LOA or facility directive.\nNOTE-\nThe landing sequence is ordinarily established by the tower.\nSEQUENCING\nEstablish radar contact before instructing a VFR aircraft to enter the traffic pattern at a specified point or vectoring the aircraft to a position in the approach sequence. Inform the pilot of the aircraft to follow when the integrity of the approach sequence is dependent on following a preceding aircraft. Ensure visual contact is established with the aircraft to follow and provide instruction to follow that aircraft.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nFOLLOW (description) (position, if necessary).\nDirect a VFR aircraft to a point near the airport to hold when a position is not available in the approach sequence for the runway in use. The aircraft may be vectored to another runway after coordination with the tower.\nApply the following procedures to a VFR aircraft being radar sequenced:\nThe provisions of paragraph 5-5-4, Minima, subparagraphs f and g.\nWhen parallel runways are less than 2,500 feet apart, do not permit a super or heavy aircraft to overtake any aircraft, nor a B757 or other large aircraft to overtake a small aircraft established on final within the facility's area of responsibility.\nCONTROL TRANSFER\nInform the tower of the aircraft's position and then instruct the pilot to contact the tower.\nThe aircraft may be instructed to contact the tower prior to the tower being advised of the aircraft's position provided:\nThe tower advises the aircraft is in sight, and\nSpace is available in the landing sequence.\nInstruct the pilot to contact the tower at the appropriate point when the approach control STARS track data is being displayed on the tower's TDW display, the aircraft is tagged by STARS, and a facility directive specifies change of communications and control jurisdiction points.\nNOTE-\nThe point at which an aircraft is instructed to contact the tower is determined by prior coordination between the tower and approach control and will vary, depending on the runway in use, weather, etc. The transfer of communications ordinarily occurs at least 5 miles from the runway. The point for the transfer of communications should be a sufficient distance from the airport to permit the tower to properly sequence the aircraft, but not at a distance that could derogate the provision of radar traffic information service.\nABANDONED APPROACH\nInstruct the aircraft to change to approach control for sequencing when an aircraft, under tower control, abandons the approach and coordination with approach control reveals no immediate space in the approach sequence.\nVFR DEPARTURE INFORMATION\nInform departing VFR aircraft who request radar traffic advisories when to contact departure control and the frequency to use. Provide traffic advisories in accordance with paragraph 2-1-21, Traffic Advisories, after the departure is radar identified.\nNOTE-\nDeparting aircraft desiring traffic information are expected to request the service and to state their proposed direction of flight upon initial contact with ground control.\nTERMINATION OF SERVICE\nBasic radar services should be provided to the extent possible, workload permitting. Terminate radar service to aircraft landing at airports other than those where sequencing service is provided at a sufficient distance from the airport to permit the pilot to change to the appropriate frequency for traffic and airport information.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRADAR SERVICE TERMINATED, SQUAWK ONE TWO ZERO ZERO,\nor\nSQUAWK VFR,\nthen\nCHANGE TO ADVISORY FREQUENCY APPROVED,\nor\nCONTACT (frequency identification),\nor\nFREQUENCY CHANGE APPROVED.\nSERVICE PROVIDED WHEN TOWER IS INOPERATIVE\nProvide the following services during hours when the tower is not in operation:\nWind direction and velocity.\nNOTE-\nIssue information provided from the FSS or WSO. Otherwise, inform the pilot that wind information is not available.\nTraffic information.\nInform aircraft when radar service is terminated.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-1-9, Radar Service Termination.\nDo not assign landing sequence.",

    "content": "Special FlightsGeneral\nSection 1. GeneralGENERAL\nProvide aircraft engaged in the flight inspection of NAVAIDs with maximum assistance. Unless otherwise agreed to, maintain direct contact with the pilot and exchange information regarding known traffic in the area and his/her intentions.\nNOTE-\nMany flight inspections are accomplished using automatic recording equipment, and an uninterrupted flight is necessary for successful completion of the mission. The workload for the limited number of aircraft engaged in these activities requires strict adherence to a schedule.\nFlight inspection operations which require special participation of ground personnel, specific communications, or radar operation capabilities are considered to require special handling. These flights are coordinated with appropriate facilities before departure.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8200.1, United States Standard Flight Inspection Manual.\nFAA Order 8240.41, Flight Inspection/Air Traffic On‐Site Coordination Requirements.\nSPECIAL HANDLING\nClear the aircraft according to pilot request as soon as practicable. Do not ask the pilot to deviate from his/her planned action except to preclude an emergency situation.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order 8240.41, Flight Inspection/Air Traffic On‐Site Coordination Requirements, Appendix 1, describes certain flight inspection maneuvers in detail.\nIssue radar advisories to the flight inspection aircraft where adequate coverage exists and to the extent permitted by workload.\nSuggest flight path adjustments, as required, for any aircraft which will enter or penetrate an area in which a flight inspection function is being performed.\nProvide special handling, as required, to FAA aircraft conducting flight inspections using the call sign “Flight Check.” Use of the term “recorded run” by Flight Check aircraft indicates automated flight inspections are in progress.\nNOTE-\nFlight Check (FLC) aircraft stating “recorded run” indicates automated flight inspections are in progress. Such inspections necessitate the full length of the runway (including protection of any critical areas) and require the entire procedure to be flown, up to and including the missed approach as needed. Any interruption of a recorded run will require the entire procedure to be reinitiated.\nFlight plan remarks may indicate type NAVAID inspection to be accomplished, e.g., “FC OKC P.”\nAuthorized non-FAA Service Providers conducting Flight Validation activities use the call sign “FLIGHT VAL.” Although these activities are similar to Flight Inspection activities, no additional priority is granted with this call sign.\nFLIGHT CHECK AIRCRAFT\nProvide special handling, as required, to expedite flight inspection of NAVAIDs and RADAR by flight check aircraft.\nNOTE-\nCertain flight inspection maneuvers require operations in close proximity to the surface. These maneuvers can only be performed during daylight visual meteorological conditions. Preplanned automatic flight places the following limitations on the capability of the pilot to adhere to normal ATC clearances:\nRoute of flight - orbital from 6 nautical miles to a maximum of 40 nautical miles from the facility depending on the type of inspection. During commissioning flight checks all SIDs, STARs, airways, DME fixes, and approaches must be flown.\nAltitude assignment - from 1,000 feet above the antenna site up to the minimum en route altitude (MEA).\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nFAA Order 8240.41, Flight Inspection/Air Traffic On‐Site Coordination Requirements, Appendix 1, describes certain flight inspection maneuvers in detail.\nAvoid changes in the route or altitude from that filed by the pilot in the initial flight plan.\nDo not impose air traffic control delays in the flight except to preclude emergency situations.\nDo not change the previously assigned discrete beacon code of special radar accuracy flight check aircraft.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 7-1-2, Special Radar Accuracy Checks.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 10-5-4, ASR Performance Checks.",

They are to be used within the ARTCC area jurisdiction from the established FL base of the high altitude sectors and above. Each high altitude sector should have the capability to use the special use frequency on a shared basis.\nUSAF, U.S. Navy, and Air National Guard (ANG) single‐pilot jet aircraft formations operating at night or in instrument weather conditions. Formations of five or more USAF aircraft deploying either to a continental U.S. staging base or nonstop to an overseas location are authorized to use special use frequencies at any time. Normally these deployments will be conducted within an altitude reservation.\nU-2 and B-57 (pressure suit flights) aircraft at all altitudes/FLs except where terminal operations require the assignment of other frequencies.\nNOTE-\nAerial refueling operations may require that aircraft leave the special use frequency for communications with the tanker. This will occur when the receiver is approximately 200 miles from the ARCP. The tanker aircraft will remain on the ARTCC assigned frequency and will relay clearances to the receiver as required. An alternate means of communications between the tanker and receiver is HF radio.\nAll aircraft during supersonic flight.\nNOTE-\nPilots are expected to request assignment of the special use frequency in the remarks section of the flight plan or before entering supersonic flight.

To identify these flights, the words “AWACS/NORAD SPECIAL” will be included as the first item in the remarks section of the flight plan.\nWEATHER RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHTS\nTEAL and NOAA mission aircraft fly reconnaissance flights to gather meteorological data on winter storms, (NWSOP missions), hurricanes and tropical cyclones (NHOP missions). The routes and timing of these flights are determined by movement of the storm areas and not by traffic flows.\nWhen a dropsonde release time is received from a TEAL or NOAA mission aircraft, workload and priorities permitting, controllers must advise the mission aircraft of any traffic estimated to pass through the area of the drop at altitudes below that of the mission aircraft. This traffic advisory must include:\nAltitude.\nDirection of flight.\nETA at the point closest to drop area (or at the fix/intersection where drop will occur).\nNOTE-\nA dropsonde is a 14-inch long cardboard cylinder about 2.75 inches in diameter, that weighs approximately 14 ounces (400 grams), and has a parachute attached. When released from the aircraft it will fall at a rate of approximately 2,500 feet per minute. Controllers should recognize that a dropsonde released at FL 310 will be a factor for traffic at FL 210 four minutes later. It is the aircraft commanders responsibility to delay release of dropsondes if traffic is a factor. Aircraft commanders will delay release of dropsondes based solely upon traffic as issued by ATC.\nWhen advised that an airborne TEAL or NOAA aircraft is requesting a clearance via CARCAH, issue the clearance in accordance with Chapter 4, IFR, Section 2, Clearances.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-1, Clearance Items.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-2, Clearance Prefix.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 4-2-3, Delivery Instructions.\nIf a TEAL or NOAA mission aircraft must be contacted but is out of VHF, UHF, and HF radio range, advise the supervisory traffic management coordinator-in-charge.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 5-3-4, Weather Reconnaissance Flights.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-1-4, Operational Priority.\nAircraft operations associated with a Weather Reconnaissance Area (WRA) must be conducted in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Aircraft Operations Center, U.S. Air Force Reserve Command 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, and the Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Organization in Support of the National Hurricane Operations Plan (FAA Order JO 7610.14, Appendix 3, Document 1), and the associated letters of agreement.\nEVASIVE ACTION MANEUVER\nApprove a pilot request to conduct an evasive action maneuver only on the basis of a permissible traffic situation. Specify the following items, as necessary, when issuing approval:\nNOTE-\nThe “evasive action” maneuver is performed by a bomber/fighter bomber aircraft at or above FL 250 along a 60 NM long segment of the flight plan route overlying a RBS or other site and includes:\nFlying a zigzag pattern on both the left and right side of the flight plan route centerline. Altitude deviations are made in conjunction with the lateral maneuvering.\nLateral deviations from the route centerline will not normally exceed 12 miles. Altitude variations must not exceed plus or minus 1,000 feet of the assigned flight level; i.e., confined within a 2,000 foot block.\nSpecific route segment on which the maneuver will take place.\nDistance of maximum route deviation from the centerline in miles.\nAltitude.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nCLEARED TO CONDUCT EVASIVE ACTION\nMANEUVER FROM (fix) TO (fix),\nand\n(number of miles) EITHER SIDE OF CENTERLINE,\nand\nMAINTAIN (altitude) THROUGH (altitude),\nand\nCOMPLETE MANEUVER AT (fix) AT (altitude).\nNONSTANDARD FORMATION/CELL OPERATIONS\nOccasionally the military is required to operate in a nonstandard cell formation and controllers should be knowledgeable of the various tactics employed and the procedures used.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7610.14, Chapter 7, Section 3, Military Formation Flight.\nFormation leaders are responsible for obtaining ATC approval to conduct nonstandard formation/cell operations.\nWhen nonstandard formation/cell operations have been approved, controllers must assign sufficient altitudes to allow intra‐cell vertical spacing of 500 feet between each aircraft in the formation.\nControl nonstandard formation/cell operations on the basis that MARSA is applicable between the participating aircraft until they establish approved separation which is acknowledged by ATC.\nApply approved separation criteria between the approved nonstandard formation/cell envelope and nonparticipating aircraft.\nClear aircraft operating in a nonstandard formation/cell to the breakup fix as the clearance limit. Forward data pertaining to route or altitude beyond the breakup point to the center concerned as a part of the routine flight plan information.\nEN ROUTE.

Unmanned Free BalloonsAPPLICATION\nFIG 9-6-1Shapes of 11 Million Cubic Feet Balloon\nat Various Altitudes\nApply the following procedures, as appropriate, when unmanned free balloons are within airspace for which you have control jurisdiction:\nNOTE-\nThese procedures apply to unmanned free balloons that carry payloads as described in 14 CFR section 101.1(a)(4). Payloads may weigh several hundred pounds and the physical shape of the balloons change at various altitudes/flight levels. (See FIG 9-6-1.) Balloon and payload ascend at an average rate of 400 feet a minute. Over the descent area, the payload is normally released from the balloon and descends by parachute at a minimum rate of 1,000 feet a minute. The balloon is normally deflated automatically when the payload is released. The operator is required to advise ATC 1 hour in advance of descent in accordance with 14 CFR section 101.39.\nPost the balloon flight on flight progress strips along the planned trajectory and revise routing as tracking/position reports require.\nNOTE-\nThe prelaunch notice information should be posted on flight progress strips for planning and operational purposes.\nRadar flight follow balloons to the extent that equipment capabilities permit. If radar flight following is not possible, tracking should be attempted by communication with the “chase plane,” telephone contact with the operator, pilot, or ground observation reports.\nNOTE-\nSome operators have equipped their balloons with transponder beacons in addition to a radar reflection device or material required by 14 CFR section 101.35, but at cruise altitude, the balloon's communications equipment and transponder, if so equipped, are operated intermittently to conserve battery energy.\nWith pilot concurrence, provide separation between aircraft and balloons when you are satisfied that the balloon information is sufficiently reliable to provide the service. Do not attempt to separate aircraft from the balloon by using vertical separation unless you have accurate balloon altitude information.\nProvide traffic advisories to all affected aircraft during initial contact specifying the balloon's known or estimated position, direction of movement, and altitude as “unknown” or “reported,” as appropriate.\nNOTE-\nUnless ATC requires otherwise, operators of unmanned free balloons are required to monitor the course of the balloon and record its position at least every two hours. As required in 14 CFR section 101.39a, balloon position reports are not forwarded by the operator unless requested by ATC.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNMANNED FREE BALLOON OVER (name of location),\nor\nESTIMATED OVER (name of location), MOVING\n(direction of movement).\nLAST REPORTED ALTITUDE AT (altitude as reported by the operator or determined from pilot report),\nor\nALTITUDE UNKNOWN.\nTo transfer flight following responsibility of balloons between facilities or between controllers,  forward the following information when available:\nREFERENCE-\n14 CFR Section 101.37, Notice Requirements.\n14 CFR Section 101.39, Balloon Position Reports.\nIdentification and type; e.g., Flight 804 Balloon.\nLast known position and altitude.\nGeneral direction of movement and speed.\nETA over facility boundary, sector boundary, or other point if believed to be reasonably accurate.\nOther pertinent information.\nIf in radar contact, physically point out the target to the receiving controller.\nThe name and the telephone number of the location where tracking is being accomplished.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 9-6-2, Derelict Balloons.\nDERELICT BALLOONS\nBalloons become derelict when a moored balloon slips its mooring and becomes a hazard to air navigation or when an unmanned free balloon flight cannot be terminated as planned. When this occurs:\nIn the case of a moored balloon which has slipped its moorings, issue traffic advisories.\nIn the case of an unmanned free balloon, flight follow the balloon and, to the extent possible, provide aircraft under your control separation from the balloon.\nForward balloon position information received from pilot reports or derived from radar returns to your supervisor for further dissemination.\nIf radar contact with the balloon is lost, broadcast an advisory to all aircraft operating in the airspace affected by the derelict balloon at 10-minute intervals continuing until the derelict balloon is no longer a factor.\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nADVISORY TO ALL AIRCRAFT.\nDERELICT BALLOON REPORTED IN THE VICINITY OF (location),\nor\nESTIMATED IN VICINITY OF (location),\nor\nREPORTED OVER (location),\nor\nRADAR REPORTED OVER (location).\nLAST REPORTED ALTITUDE/FLIGHT LEVEL AT (altitude/flight level as reported by operator or pilot report),\nor\nALTITUDE/FLIGHT LEVEL UNKNOWN.\nTransfer flight following responsibility as outlined in paragraph 9-6-1, Application, subparagraph e.\nREFERENCE-\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 19-5-2, Derelict Balloons/Objects.",
